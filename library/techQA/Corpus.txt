IBM STREAMS 4.1.1.1 and 4.1.1.2  JOBS DO NOT INHERIT THE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES SET IN .BASHRC, WHEN STREAMS IS RUN AS A SYSTEM SERVICE - United States  FLASH (ALERT)

ABSTRACT
 In Streams 4.1.1.1 and 4.1.1.2 Streams jobs may not pick up the user enviroment from the streams user's .bashrc. This behavior is different from earlier releases. With these versions, when Streams is run as a system service, application environment variables must be set with streamtool. 

CONTENT
Problem Description
When running Streams as a system service with Streams releases 4.1.1.1
or 4.1.1.2, toolkits and user applications that depend on the
user environment may have various errors.
For example the database toolkit might show the following error
if it does not pick up the ODBCINI environment variable:



 * "An SQL operation failed. The SQL state is 08003, the SQL code
   is 0 and the SQL message is [unixODBC][Driver
   Manager]Connnection does not exist."
 * 

Problem Solution 

To work around the issue, set environment variables that are needed by the application directly in the instance with:  * 
   
 * streamtool setproperty
 * -d <domain> -i <instance>
   --application-ev <VARIABLE NAME>=<VARIABLE VALUE>
 *

 IBM Exit() action within User Defined Function in Impact Policy Language - United States netcool; impact; netcool/impact; nci; ipl; policy; language; exit; exit(); function; user; defined; custom; udf; parser; action; set; global; variable; var; get; setglobalvar; getglobalvar; globalvar TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 and how to exit the Policy process from within a Custom Function 

CAUSE
Using the Exit() parser function within a User Defined (or Custom) Function in Impact Policy Language (IPL) will not exit the Policy process, it will only exit the User Defined Function.

ANSWER
This is because the Exit() parser function in IPL is designed to exit the immediate scope. To carry the action outside of the User Defined Function to the Policy level one would have to set a variable that is then tested immediately after the User Defined Function call - for example: 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * SetGlobalVar("ExitNow", 1);
 * 
 * Exit();
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * SetGlobalVar("ExitNow", 1);
 * 
 * Exit();
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * If(GetGlobalVar("ExitNow") == 1)
 * 
 * {
   Log(ID+WP+": Existing policy...");
   
 * Exit
 * ();
   }


The above example ties in somewhat with the exampled configuration from the TechNote "Event Flagging with Go_NoGo checking" [ link below] and uses structured logging as covered in the TechNote "Structured logging in Policies" [ link below]. 

If the User Defined Function was nested within another User Defined Function one would have to exit each layer to return the Policy layer before the Exit() action would exit the Policy.

 IBM Guide to properly setting up SSL within the IBM HTTP Server - United States ssl; handshake; secure socket layer; handshake failed; enable; ssl config; ssl setup; setup; IHS; crl; revocation; ssl; ssl; ssl; configure; config; config; config TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The following information can be used as a guide for setting up the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) within the IBM HTTP Server. This document covers information on setting up SSL virtualhosts, creating keyfiles, certificates along with how to protect access to directories and URLs to specific ciphers. Also, included is documentation on how to trace and record SSL traffic between a client browser and the Web server. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The following steps help guide you through the proper set up of SSL within the IBM HTTP Server: 

 1. Confirm that the Global Security Kit (GSKit) is installed and meets the minimum requirements
    
    
 2. Create a key database file and certificates needed to authenticate the Web server during an SSL handshake
    
    
 3. Enable SSL directives within the IBM HTTP Server configuration file (httpd.conf)
    
    
 4. Other considerations when enabling SSL directives within the IBM HTTP Server configuration file (httpd.conf)
    
    
 5. Information that IBM WebSphere® Support needs to debug SSL configuration and certificate issues related to the IBM HTTP Server






 1. Confirm that the Global Security Kit is installed and meets the minimum requirements
    
    The Global Security Kit (GSKit) is a required component for the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) enablement within the IBM HTTP Server. Therefore, it is important to confirm that a supported version of the Global Security Kit is installed prior to enabling SSL.
    
    For a complete listing of IBM HTTP Server releases and corresponding Global Security Kit versions, click IBM HTTP Server: Global Security Kit (GSKit) supported versions [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=177&context=SSEQTJ&uid=swg21173214].
    
    
    
 2. Create a key database file and certificates needed to authenticate the Web server during an SSL handshake
    
    The iKeyman GUI, which is included within the IBM HTTP Server distribution, can be used to create a key database file (for example: key.kdb) needed to store personal server certificates required by the client browser during an SSL handshake.
    
    For quick information on how to create a key database file and personal server certificates, refer to the technote IKEYMAN, How do I...? [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=177&context=SSEQTJ&uid=swg21006430] 
    
    More extensive information on using the iKeyman GUI to create key database files and certificates is located here:  * For releases of IBM HTTP Server v7.0 [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.websphere.ihs.doc%2Finfo%2Fihs%2Fihs%2Fwelc_ikeymangui.html] 
     * For releases of IBM HTTP Server v8.0 [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v8r0/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.websphere.ihs.doc%2Finfo%2Fihs%2Fihs%2Fwelc_ikeymangui.html] 
     * For releases of IBM HTTP Server v8.5 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSD28V_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.ihs.doc/ihs/welc_ikeymangui.html] 
     * For releases of IBM HTTP Server v9.0 [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_9.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.ihs.doc/ihs/welc_ikeymangui.html] 
       
       
    
    
 3. Enable SSL directives within the IBM HTTP Server's configuration file (httpd.conf)
     1. Verify that the SSL modules are uncommented
         * For Microsoft® Windows®:
           
           
           LoadModule ibm_ssl_module modules/mod_ibm_ssl.so [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21179559&amp;aid=1]
           
           
         * For UNIX® platforms:
           
           
           LoadModule ibm_ssl_module modules/mod_ibm_ssl.so [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21179559&amp;aid=2]
           
           
        
        
     2. Create an SSL virtualhost stanza using the following examples and directives
        
        If you are enabling one Web site for SSL, and the hostname is the same as the one already defined in the Global Scope for non-SSL (port 80), you can enable SSL as follows. This virtualhost uses the default hostname defined by the ServerName directive in the Global Scope and the IP address associated with it.
        
        http://www.mycompany.com (non-SSL) 192.168.1.102 https://www.mycompany.com (SSL) 192.168.1.102
        
        Example 1:
        
        Listen 80
        ServerName www.mycompany.com
        
        <Directory "c:/Program Files/IBM HTTP Server/htdocs">
        Options Indexes
        AllowOverride None
        order allow,deny
        allow from all
        </Directory>
        
        DocumentRoot "c:/program files/ibm http server/htdocs"
        DirectoryIndex index.html
        
        Listen 443
        <VirtualHost :443>
        SSLEnable
        SSLClientAuth None
        </VirtualHost>
        
        SSLDisable
        KeyFile "c:/program files/ibm http server/key.kdb"
        SSLV2Timeout 100
        SSLV3Timeout 1000 [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21179559&amp;aid=3]
        
        If you are enabling one Web site for SSL and the ServerName is different than the ServerName already defined in the Global Scope for non-SSL (port 80), you can enable SSL as follows. Both hostnames must be registered in DNS to a separate IP address, and both IP addresses must be configured on local network interface cards.
        
        http://www.mycompany.com (non-SSL) 192.168.1.102 http://www.mycompany2.com (non-SSL) 192.168.1.103 https://www.mycompany2.com (SSL) 192.168.1.103
        
        Example 2:
        
        Listen 80
        ServerName www.mycompany.com
        
        <Directory "c:/Program Files/IBM HTTP Server/htdocs">
        Options Indexes
        AllowOverride None
        order allow,deny
        allow from all
        </Directory>
        
        DocumentRoot "c:/program files/ibm http server/htdocs"
        DirectoryIndex index.html
        
        <VirtualHost 192.168.1.103:80>
        ServerName www.mycompany2.com
        <Directory "c:/Program Files/IBM HTTP Server/htdocs2">
        Options Indexes
        AllowOverride None
        order allow,deny
        allow from all
        </Directory>
        DocumentRoot "c:/program files/ibm http server/htdocs2"
        DirectoryIndex index2.html
        </VirtualHost>
        
        Listen 443
        <VirtualHost 192.168.1.103:443>
        ServerName www.mycompany2.com
        SSLEnable
        SSLClientAuth None
        <Directory "c:/Program Files/IBM HTTP Server/htdocs2">
        Options Indexes
        AllowOverride None
        order allow,deny
        allow from all
        </Directory>
        DocumentRoot "c:/program files/ibm http server/htdocs2"
        DirectoryIndex index2.html
        </VirtualHost>
        
        SSLDisable
        KeyFile "c:/program files/ibm http server/key.kdb"
        SSLV2Timeout 100
        SSLV3Timeout 1000 
        If you are enabling multiple Web sites for SSL, you can enable SSL as follows. All hostnames must be registered in DNS to a separate IP address. Also, all the IP addresses must be configured on a local network interface card. You must use the SSLServerCert directive to identify which personal server certificate in the key database file is passed to the client browser during the SSL handshake for each Web site. If the SSLServerCert directive is not defined, the IBM HTTP Server passes whatever certificate in the key database file is marked(*) as the "default key".

        Example 3:
        
        Listen 80
        ServerName www.mycompany.com

 4. Other considerations when enabling SSL directives within the IBM HTTP Server configuration file (httpd.conf).
    
     * How to rewrite HTTP (port 80) requests to HTTPS (port 443)
       The rewrite module (mod_rewrite.c) provided with the IBM HTTP Server can be used as an effective way to automatically rewrite all HTTP requests to HTTPS. For complete information click How to rewrite HTTP (port 80) requests to HTTPS (port 443) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=177&context=SSEQTJ&uid=swg21114864].
       
       
     * Logging SSL request information in the access log for IBM HTTP Server
       The IBM HTTP Server implementation provides Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) environment variables that are configurable with the LogFormat directive in httpd.conf. For complete information click Logging SSL request information in the access log for IBM HTTP Server [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=177&context=SSEQTJ&uid=swg21176455].
       
       
     * Enabling Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL) in the IBM HTTP Server
       Certificate revocation provides the ability to revoke a client certificate given to the IBM HTTP Server by the browser when the key is compromised or when access permission to the key is revoked. CRL represents a database that contains a list of certificates revoked before their scheduled expiration date.

 IBM 2035 MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED Connecting to WebSphere MQ from WebSphere Application Server via CLIENT Bindings - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This article covers the most common reasons why an application running in WebSphere Application Server receives a 2035 MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED error when connecting to MQ as a client over a network. Quick steps to work around the MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED errors during development are provided in the 'Resolving the problem' section, as well as considerations for implementing security in production environments. A summary is also provided of behavior for outbound scenarios with container-managed and component-managed security, as well as inbound behavior for listener ports and activiation specifications 

SYMPTOM
JMSCMQ0001: WebSphere MQ call failed with compcode '2' ('MQCC_FAILED') reason '2035' ('MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED')


CAUSE
The two most likely reasons why the connection is refused by MQ are as follows: 

 1. The user identifier passed across the client connection from the application server to MQ is not known on the server where the MQ queue manager is running, is not authorised to connect to MQ, or is longer than 12 characters and has been truncated.
    We discuss how this user identifier is obtained and passed over the connection in more detail below.
    For queue managers running on Windows, the following error might be seen in the MQ error logs for this scenario:
    AMQ8075: Authorization failed because the SID for entity 'wasuser' cannot be obtained.
    For UNIX no entry in the MQ error logs would be seen by default.
    See technote MQS_REPORT_NOAUTH environment variable can be used to better diagnose return code 2035 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg21299319] for details of enabling error log entries on all platforms. 
 2. The user identifier passed across the client connection from the application server to MQ is a member of the 'mqm' group on the server hosting the MQ queue manager, and a Channel Authentication Record (CHLAUTH) exists that blocks administrative access to the queue manager. WebSphere MQ configures a CHLAUTH record by default in WebSphere MQ Version 7.1 and later that blocks all MQ admins from connecting as a client to the queue manager.
    The following error in the MQ error logs would be seen for this scenario:
    AMQ9777: Channel was blocked

See the Error logs on Windows, UNIX and Linux systems [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r5/topic/com.ibm.mq.tro.doc/q039560_.htm] section of the MQ Information Center for the location of the MQ error logs. 
DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
To understand the cause of the MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED reason code, you need to understand what username (and password) is being used by MQ to authorise the application server. 

Please note that WebSphere MQ V7.5 and earlier does not provide any out-of-the box password authentication system for client connections.
Password authentication is provided out of the box in IBM MQ V8.0. More details on the new IBM MQ V8.0 security features are available in this presentation [https://www.slideshare.net/MoragHughson/websphere-mq-v8-security-deep-dive]. 

For WebSphere MQ V7.5 and earlier, this means that while the understanding provided in this technote over how usernames/passwords are passed from the application server to MQ is helpful for development environments, solving the security requirements of production environments usually also requires one of the following approaches: 

 * Mutual SSL/TLS authentication.
   MQ provides out-of-the-box features to authenticate a remotely attaching client using the digital certificate they provide for SSL/TLS transport security. For example by configuring an SSLPEER rule on the SVRCONN channel to match the Distinguished Name in the certificate of the WebSphere Application Server, and establishing trust in the issuer of that certificate. 
 * A custom, or 3rd party supplied, WebSphere MQ Security Exit
   A security exit can be written for MQ that performs username and password authentication against a repository, such as the local operating system on the MQ server, or an LDAP repository.
   When using a security exit for authentication it is important that SSL/TLS transport security is still configured, to ensure passwords are not sent in plain text.


MCA user ID (MCAUSER) configured on the Server Connection (SVRCONN) channel If an MCAUSER is configured on the SVRCONN channel that the application server is using to connect, and no security exit or mapping Channel Authentication Record is installed, then this overrides the username provided by the application server. 

It is common practice for many customers to set an MCAUSER on every SVRCONN channel, and use mutual SSL/TLS authentication exclusively for authentication. 

Default behaviour when no credentials are supplied in the application server 

If no credentials are supplied by the application on the createConnection call, and neither of the component managed or container managed security systems described below are configured, then WebSphere Application Server provides a blank username to MQ. This causes MQ to authorise the client based on the userid that the MQ listener is running under. In the majority of cases this is 'mqm' on UNIX/Linux systems and 'MUSR_MQADMIN' on Windows. 

As these are administrative MQ users, they will be blocked by default in WebSphere MQ V7.1 and higher, with a AMQ9777 error logged in the error logs of the queue manager. 

Container-managed security for outbound connections 

The recommended way to configure the username and password passed to MQ by the application server for outbound connections, is to use container-managed security. Outbound connections are those created using a Connection Factory, rather than a Listener Port or Activation Specification. 

Usernames of 12 characters or less are passed to MQ by the appliaction server. Usernames longer than 12 characters in length will be truncated, either during authorisation (on UNIX), or in the MQMD of messages that are sent. 

Container-managed security means that the deployment descriptor, or EJB 3.0 annotations, of the application declare a resource reference with authentication type set to Container. 

Then when the application looks up the Connection Factory in JNDI, it does so indirectly via the resource reference. For example an EJB 2.1 application would perform a JNDI lookup as follows, where "jms/MyResourceRef" has been declared as a resource reference in the deployment descriptor: 

ConnectionFactory myCF = (ConnectionFactory)ctx.lookup("java:comp/env/jms/MyResourceRef") 

An EJB 3.0 application might declare an annotated object property on the bean as follows:
@Resource(name = "jms/MyResourceRef", 
authenticationType = AuthenticationType.CONTAINER)
private javax.jms.ConnectionFactory myCF; 

When the application is deployed by an administrator, they bind this authentication alias to an actual Connection Factory that has been created in JNDI, and assign it a J2C authentication alias on deployment. 

It is the username and password contained in this authentication alias that is then passed to MQ/JMS by the application server when the application connects. This approach puts the administrator in control of which username and password is used by each application, and prevents a different application from looking up the connection factory in JNDI directly to connect with the same username and password. 

A default container-managed authentication alias can be supplied on the configuration panels in the administrative console for MQ connection factories. This default will only be used in the case that an application uses a resource reference configured for container-managed security, but the administrator has not bound it to an authentication alias during deployment. A screen shot is provided below:
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21636093&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21636093&aid=1] 

Default component-managed authentication alias for outbound connections 

For cases where it is impractical to change the application to use container-managed security, or to change it to supply a username and password directly on the createConnection call, it is possible to supply a default. 

This default is called the "component-managed authentication alias" and cannot be configured via the administrative console (since WebSphere Application Server Version 7.0 when it was removed from the panels MQ connection factories). The below scripting samples show how to configure it using wsadmin: 

 * JACL:
   wsadmin>set cell [ $AdminConfig getid "/Cell:mycell" ]
   
   mycell(cells/mycell|cell.xml#Cell_1)
   
   wsadmin>$AdminTask listWMQConnectionFactories $cell
   
   MyCF(cells/mycell|resources.xml#MQConnectionFactory_1247500675104)
   
   wsadmin>$AdminTask modifyWMQConnectionFactory MyCF(cells/mycell|resources.xml#MQConnectionFactory_1247500675104) { -componentAuthAlias myalias }
   
   MyCF(cells/mycell|resources.xml#MQConnectionFactory_1247500675104) 
 * Jython:
   wsadmin>cell = AdminConfig.getid("/Cell:mycell")
   
   wsadmin>AdminTask.listWMQConnectionFactories(cell)
   
   'MyCF(cells/mycell|resources.xml#MQConnectionFactory_1247500675104)'
   
   wsadmin>AdminTask.modifyWMQConnectionFactory('MyCF(cells/mycell|resos urces.xml#MQConnectionFactory_1247500675104)', "-componentAuthAlias myalias")
   
   'MyCF(cells/mycell|resources.xml#MQConnectionFactory_1247500675104)'


Authentication alias for inbound MDB connections using an activation specification For inbound connections using an activation specification an authentication alias can be specified by the administrator when deploying the application, or a default authentication alias can be specified on the activation specification via the administrative console. 

Authentication alias for inbound MDB connections using a listener port 

For inbound connections using a listener port, the value specified in the "Container-managed authentication alias" setting of the connection factory (seen in the above screenshot) is used. 

On zOS, first the "Container-managed authentication alias" is checked and used if set, then the "Component-managed authentication alias" is checked and used it set.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The simplest steps to resolve the 2035 MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED errors in a development environment, where full transport security is not required, are as follows: 

 1. Choose a user that you want WebSphere Application Server to be authenticated as. Typically the user chosen should have authority relevant to the context of the operations required by the application running in WebSphere Application Server and no more. For example, 'mqm' or other super user is not appropriate. 
 2. If this user is an MQ administrative user, then relax the Channel Authentication Record (CHLAUTH) security in MQ V7.1 or higher, so that administrative connections are not blocked on the SVRCONN channel you wish to use. An example MQSC command to do this for a SVRCONN channel called 'WAS.CLIENTS' is provided as follows:
    SET CHLAUTH('WAS.CLIENTS') TYPE(BLOCKUSER) USERLIST(ALLOWANY) 
 3. Configure the SVRCONN channel to set the MCA user ID (MCAUSER) to the user you have chosen. An example MQSC command to configure a SVRCONN channel to use 'myuser' as the MCA user ID is provided as follows:
    ALTER CHL('WAS.CLIENTS') CHLTYPE(SVRCONN) MCAUSER('myuser')


The following additional considerations are important for production environments: For all production environments where transport security is required, SSL/TLS security must be configured between the application server and MQ. 

In order to configure SSL/TLS transport security, you must establish the appropriate trust between the MQ queue manager and WebSphere Application Server. The application server, who initiates the SSL/TLS handshake, must always be configured to trust the certificate provided by the MQ queue manager . If the application server is configured to send a certificate to the MQ queue manager, then the queue manager must also be configured to trust it. 

If trust is not correctly configured on both sides, you will encounter 2393 MQRC_SSL_INITIALIZATION_ERROR reason codes after enabling SSL/TLS on the connection. 

If you do not have a security exit that performs username and password authentication, then you should configure mutual SSL/TLS authentication on your Server Connection channel to cause the queue manager to require a trusted certificate is provided by the application server. To do this you set "SSL Authentication" to "Required" in the MQ Explorer or SSLCAUTH(REQUIRED) via MQSC. 

If you do have a security exit that performs username and password authentication installed in your MQ server, then configure your application to supply a username and password for validation by that security exit. The details of how to configure the username and password passed to MQ by the application server are described above in the "Diagnosing the problem" section. 

All Server Connection channels that do not have SSL/TLS security applied should be disabled. Example MQSC commands to disable the SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN channel are provided as follows (these assume no user exists on the MQ server called 'NOAUTH'):
ALTER CHL(SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN) CHLTYPE(SVRCONN) MCAUSER('NOAUTH')
STOP CHL(SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN) 

Details of how to configure the private certificate and trust of a MQ queue manager, and to enable SSL security on a Server Connection channel, see the following locations in the MQ information center: 

 * To configure the certificates and trust of the MQ queue manager see the following topic:
   Configuring SSL on queue managers [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.mq.explorer.doc%2Fe_ssl_channels.htm] 
 * To configure the Server Connection channel, used by applications running in the application server to connect to MQ, see the following topic:
   Configuring SSL channels [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.mq.explorer.doc/e_ssl_channels.htm]


Details of how you configure trust within WebSphere Application Server, and whether the application server sends a certificate to MQ for authentication, are in the following locations in the WebSphere Application Server information center:  * To create or modify an SSL Configuration containing the appropriate SSL/TLS configuration for connecting to MQ, see the following topic:
   SSL configurations [http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/wsbroker/redirect?version=phil&product=was-base-dist&topic=csec_sslconfigs]
   Note that MQ requires you specify a matching Cipher Suite / Cipher Spec on both sides of the connection, as it checks the negotiated Cipher Suite matches the SSLCIPH setting on the channel after the handshake is complete. As a result the WebSphere Application Server SSL Configuration should be configured to contain only the Cipher Suite that matches the SSLCIPH setting on the Server Connection channel. See the following topic in the MQ information center for details of matching pairs:
   CipherSuite and CipherSpec name mappings for connections to a WebSphere® MQ queue manager [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.mq.msc.doc/xms_csecure_mapping_wmq.html]

 * Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software 
 * Rational Software Architect 
 * Rational Software Modeler 
 * Rational Systems Developer


Similarly, Rational Application Developer (RAD) and Rational Software Architect (RSA) version 8.0 to 8.0.2 are only supported on specified 64 bit operating systems running in 32 bit mode. Rational Application Developer v8.0.3+ is available as a 64-bit application install on specified 64-bit operating systems, in addition to a 32-bit application install.
There is only one installation package. When installing RAD/RSA using IBM Installation Manager, on the Location page , if your operating system is 64-bit, then select 64-bit or 32-bit to install the product in the corresponding bit mode. 

 

These products will be referred to generically as Rational Software Development Platform (RSDP) based products. For example, WebSphere Integration Developer v6.x/7.x is RSDP based. 

Examples of some 64 bit Operating Systems: 

 * Microsoft Windows XP Professional x64 Edition (running on an AMD or Intel processor) 
 * Microsoft Windows 7 Professional 64-bit 
 * Red Hat Linux Enterprise Server 4+ running on x86-64 bit 
 * RAD 9.0 under 9.0.1 introduced support for Mac OS x - Lion 10.7 32 bit (with Oracle JDK for Mac OS X 7.0 Update 40) and Mountain Lion 10.8 - 32 bit. Likewise for RSA for WebSphere 9.0.0.1.
   RAD 9.0.1.1 introduced support for 64-bit exploit on Mac OS x Mavericks 10.9 ( with Oracle JDK for Mac OS X 7.0 Update 71)
   RSA 9.1.2 introduced support for 64-bit exploit on Mac OS X Yosemite 10.10 and OS X El Capitan 10.11 (with Oracle JDK 7.0 Update 75 for OS X)



Note: RSDP 32-bit JVM based products, do not require any additional or special set-up on a supported 64-bit operating system (O/S). 
They run on the provided/supported 32-bit JVM for that RSDP product, as is.

WebSphere Servers that are shipped with RSDP products: 

The various WebSphere Application Server v6.x/7.x servers shipped with Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect {for WebSphere} prior to v8.0.4 are only provided as 32 bit editions. As of Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect {for WebSphere} v8.0.4+, 64 bit editions of WebSphere Application Server v6.x/7.x servers are shipped in addition to the 32 bit editions. 

The WebSphere Application Server v8.x (not beta) server shipped with Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect {for WebSphere} v8.0.3+ is provided as one edition, and there is an installation option to install either the 32 bit or 64 bit JVM/JRE (IBM Software Development Kit (SDK)). Any 64 bit edition or 64-bit JVM requires a supported 64 bit operating system. This IBM Education Assistant Module/PDF : IBM WebSphere Application Server V8 Distributed platform installation [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/ieduasst/v1r1m0/topic/com.ibm.iea.was_v8/was/8.0/Installation/WASV8_dist_install.pdf] , demonstrates selecting a 32-bit or 64-bit SDK as part of a WAS v8.0 install using IBM Installation manager. If the WAS v8.0 installation is on a 32-bit operating system, this feature choice between IBM 32-bit SDK Java 6.0 or IBM 64-bit SDK Java 6.0 is not available and the installation will automatically default to the IBM 32-bit SDK Java 6.0. 

The shipped WebSphere Portal Server v6.x/7.x servers are 32 bit or 64 bit editions. depending on whether you chose the IBM WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment, 32-bit or 64-bit server to install on. 

Note: It is possible to work with any 64 bit remotely accessible or local stand-alone WebSphere Application Server v6.x/7.x/8.x. In Rational Application Developer 8.0.3+ be aware of the Info Center topic: Creating profiles for WebSphere Application Server on a 64-bit machine [Creating%20profiles%20for%20WebSphere%20Application%20Server%20on%20a%2064-bit%20machine] and see this APAR opened against RAD 8.5.1/8.5.5 : PI06339: A 64-bit install of the WebSphere Application Server Profile Management Tool may not launch on Windows 7.

CAUSE
The non-root ID that is being used to start WebSphere Application Server does not have a user_home directory. Therefore this non-root ID is unable to access the root user's "/etc/.java/.systemPrefs". This produces the aforementioned warning messages every 30 seconds in the profile_root/logs/server_name/systemout.log.

The root ID used to start Websphere Application Server can not find the Java system pref file. 


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
For non-root, you can confirm this issue by trying to start WebSphere using the "root" ID. Review the Websphere_Home/profiles/<profile_name>/logs/<failing server_name/systemout.log to verify that you no longer see the warning messages. 


For root, verify if the /etc/.java/.systemPrefs exists


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
For non-root : 

Create a User_Home directory for this non-root user and restart WebSphere Application Server. If this does not resolve the issue use the following 2 suggestions below : 

NOTE : The "dot" in front of the directories below represent that these are "hidden" directories. So the "dot" must be in front of the directory name to go into the directory or to access them. 

1. Try giving 755 permission for /home/wasadmin/.java/.userPrefs 

2. Add "-Djava.util.prefs.userRoot=/home/wasadmin/preps" as a SDK generic jvm argument 


To set the argument on the SDK: 

 1. In the administrative console, click Servers > Server Types > WebSphere application servers , and select the server that you want to add the generic argument to.. 
 2. Then, in the Server Infrastructure section, click Java and process management > Process definition > Java virtual machine. 
 3. Specify -Djava.util.prefs.userRoot=/home/wasadmin/preps for the Generic JVM Arguments property, and click OK . 
 4. Click Save to save your changes. 
 5. Restart the application server.


For root :  1. Create a Java system pref directory
    sudo mkdir -p /etc/.java/.systemPrefs 
 2. Restart the application server.

 IBM Insufficient ulimit Value Causes Native OutOfMemory - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 An out of memory may be observed on a system running WebSphere Application Server on Linux or AIX that is due to ulimit restrictions on number of process/threads per user. Further investigation may reveal a "Failed to create a thread:" message within the generated javacore which would indicate a native out of memory issue has been encountered. The cause of the problem may be an insufficient ulimit setting. While this type of issue can occur on any level of Linux, or AIX, the issue is most likely to be seen in systems running multiple instances of WebSphere Application Server using one userid. The following will outline how to identify if a process ulimit is the culprit and what WebSphere Application Server Support recommends to fix the case. 

SYMPTOM
An out of memory Dump Event such as: 

"systhrow" (00040000) Detail "java/lang/OutOfMemoryError"
"Failed to create a thread: retVal -1073741830, errno 11" received

Note: This detailed message will appear only in javacores.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
When using WebSphere Application Server, ulimits can be set to fix or tune around a number of problems. For more on how to set a ulimit refer to the "Guidelines for setting ulimits [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21469413]" Technote which goes into detail on setting different ulimits on various operating systems and the difference between the soft and hard limit. This article is concerned particularly with the "-u" ulimit or "nproc" limit on Linux, the ulimit - r on AIX which affects the number of threads allowed for a single user process running WebSphere Application Server. 

The AIX issue is less commonly seen as it limits then number of threads for a process but is seen in application servers with very large thread pools, This is becoming more common in 64bit addressing JVMs running complex applications. WebSphere Application support recommends setting the ulimit -r ulimited on AIX.

The nproc limit usually only counts processes on a server towards determining this number. Linux systems running WebSphere Application Server are a particular case. The nproc limit on Linux counts the number of threads within all processes that can exist for a given user. To determine the ulimit settings of a WebSphere Application Server process running on Linux refer to "How to determine the ulimit settings of a running WebSphere Application Server process on Linux [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21407889]".

User Limits (in bytes except for NOFILE and NPROC) 

type soft limit hard limit RLIMIT_AS unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_CORE unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_CPU unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_DATA unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_FSIZE unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_LOCKS unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_MEMLOCK 65536 65536 RLIMIT_NOFILE 65536 65536 RLIMIT_NPROC 131072 131072 

For most cases of older versions of Linux this value will be defaulted to around 2048. For out of the box Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6 the default value for nproc will be set to 1024. This low default setting for larger systems will not allow for enough threads in all processes. 

WebSphere Application Server Support recommends setting the ulimit -u or nproc to a value of 131072 when running on Linux to safely account for all the forked threads within processes that could be created. 

By using this recommended value a sufficient number of threads in all processes will be allowed and will not be a limiting factor for the environment. Increasing the limit to the suggested value should have no negative impact. When the number of threads in all processes reaches the -u ulimit, an out of memory error message will be thrown. This issue can be avoided by increasing this limit. Be aware that if the number of threads/processes reaches the recommended number of 131072 or close, the issue may be deeper and continuing to increase the -u ulimit will only prove to be a temporary fix. 

Once the ulimit is increased, the WebSphere Application Server will need to be restarted to use the 
new setting. In the case of WebSphere Application Server ND, the nodeagent and the servers on the nodes will need to be restarted. 

 IBM Applying TIP 2.2 fix packs directly to a TIP 2.1 installation - United States TIPL2; TIPL2INST; tivoli Integrated portal; feature pack TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Can Tivoli Integrated Portal 2.2 fix packs be applied directly to a TIP 2.1 installation?


ANSWER
In order to apply TIP 2.2 fix packs, the target TIP installation must already be at TIPCore 2.2.0 or newer. TIP 2.1 installations must be upgraded to TIP 2.2 using the TIP 2.2.0.1 feature pack. The TIP 2.2.0.1 feature pack can be acquired from IBM Fix Central [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~Tivoli&product=ibm/Tivoli/Tivoli+Integrated+Portal&release=All&platform=All&function=all]. 

The following three items should be obtained from Fix Central: 

 * 2.2.0.1-TIV-TIP-<platform>-RP0001 
 * 2.2.0.1-TIV-TIP-FITSuit-RP0001vx 
 * 2201-fixpack-guide-PDF.pdf



To determine the installed TIPCore version, review the DE listIU command output. Details on the listIU command are included in the following technical note: 
http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21615989 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21615989] 

 IBM Problems installing NMA agent  (N4 agent) on Linux x86-64 - United States ITM Virtual environments install NMA N4 unable find bundle prerequisites CI addbundles TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The installation of NMA agent from package ITM for Virtual Environment V7.2.0.3 is failing with both remote or local installation on Linux x86-64. 

SYMPTOM
1) The import of the whole bundle using command: 

/opt/IBM/ITM/bin/tacmd addbundles -i <inst_media>/ITMfVE_Agents/unix

will fail with message:

Unable to find bundle prerequisite: ci 06.22.04.000 li6263

--

2) Even if you succeed in importing the bundle, the remote deploy of N4 agent on a Linux X86_64 fails because the installer recognizes the target node as a 64bit while the agent comes with a different architecture (li6263).

--

3) If you try to install the ITM for VE agents locally on a Linux x86_64, the usual installation procedure does not work for the same reason of point 2.
The installer recognizes the target node as a 64bit platform and the agents are 32bit and so it does not show the expected list of agents.


CAUSE
The causes for the three scenarios depends on wrong prerequisite levels packaged into ITM for VE 7.2.0.3 for NMA agent, and on unexpected architecture recognized by the installer when trying to install the agent on the target node, if this one is a Linux x86-64.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The issues should be corrected at Installer level, APAR IV84919 has been opened to fix them. 

Anyway, since the correction involves the installation component, it will not be available until next release, when the Installation package will be built again. 

Until then, you can bypass the issue with some manual steps. 

--------------- 

1) If the import of agent bundle using command tacmd addbundles fails with message: 

Unable to find bundle prerequisite: ci 06.22.04.000 li6263

this occurs because some agents, particularly N4 agent, have old prerequisites for shared components (ax, ui, gs,jr) that are not part of the ITM_for_VE bundle. 

There is actually a workaround to correctly import the bundle in the depot, but it will not be of any help because remote installation of N4 agent will then fail due to the problem described in item number 2. 

It can be anyway useful to know the workaround as it can be applied to other agents for which remote installation instead correctly works.

You must verify if the prerequisites mentioned in the error message are already present in your depot by using command tacmd viewdepot.
Beside of the one mentioned in the error message, you must be sure that also the other wanted prerequisites are already present in the depot.

N4 agent has the following prerequisites:

Product Code : n4 
Deployable : True 
Version : 062200000 
Description : Monitoring Agent for Network Devices 
Host Type : li6263 
Host Version : li6263,lx8266 
Prerequisites: ci:062204000 la:ipaddr05400 gs:074027000 jr:051201000 
ui:062204000 ax:062204000

If all of them are already in the depot, then you can run the tamcd addbundles using flag "-n" (ignore prerequisites), this will allow to correctly import the agent bundle.

If you do not have the wanted prerequisite levels, you have two possible options:

a) retrieve and add them into depot from other ITM installation packages
b) modify the agent dsc files and change the level of the components required by the agent to match the level delivered with the bundle.

For example, ITM for Virtual Environment 7.2.0.3 delivers CI component at level 06.30.05.000, so if we consider N4 agent, you may need to change the file n4li6263.dsc in the rows:

<PrereqProdCode>ci</PrereqProdCode>

<PrereqVersion>

<Version>06</Version>

<Release>22</Release>

<Mod>04</Mod>

<Level>000</Level>


to 


<PrereqProdCode>ci</PrereqProdCode>

<PrereqVersion>

<Version>06</Version>

<Release>30</Release>

<Mod>05</Mod>

<Level>000</Level> 

 

The same for other components in case they are also missing from your depot. 

The dsc files are into <installation_media>/ITMfVE_Agents/unix folder. 

Repeat the tacmd addbundles command and it should now work fine. 

As previously said, please consider that this scenario may occur also for agents different than N4, and the workaround is applicable also for them. 

Of course the target dsc file name changes accordingly to the agent type and related architecture. 

 

2) The above workaround can help in case the issue is only related to backleveled prerequisite packages. 

Anyway, once you applied it, if the target node for the N4 agent is a Linux x86-64, you will anyway not be able to install it remotely.
The remote deploy of N4 agent on a Linux X86_64 fails because the installer recognizes the target node as a 64bit while the agent comes with a different architecture (li6263). 
The quickest workaround in this case is to install the agent locally.

3) If you try to install the ITM for VE agents locally on a Linux x86_64, the usual installation procedure does not work for the same reason of point 2. 
The installer recognizes the target node as a 64bit platform and the agents are 32bit. 
So the installer menu will show no available agents to be installed.

You need to proceed as follow:

a) Run the local installation of N4 agent on target machine and proceed as usual when you are prompted with Installer initial questions.
b) Select Other operating systems when you are showed this panel

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21983839&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21983839&aid=1]

c) Then select Linux Intel R2.6 R3.0 (32 bit)

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21983839&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21983839&aid=2]

d) At this point you will see the list of agents that can be installed on the machine. Select the option for the n4 agent and installation will be completed successfully

 IBM Guidelines for setting ulimits (WebSphere Application Server) - United States ulimits; linux; unix; aix; openfiles; opensockets; sockets; socket; files; ulimit-n; limits.conf; configuration; security; etc; root; init; crontask; cron; nodeagent; dmgr; appserver; server; applicationserver; application; nofile; unlimited; 8000; 8192 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This document describes various ways to set ulimit values on UNIX and Linux operating systems as well as information that pertains to WebSphere Application Server 

SYMPTOM
Tuning ulimits correctly can overcome these errors: 

 * Too Many Open Files 
 * Could not lock User prefs. Unix Error Code 24. 
 * Truncated Core Dumps / Heap Dumps


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

Is it possible to display the current ulimit settings? The command ulimit -Xa will display all current settings that are set for the current login session, where X represents the hard (H) or soft (S) limits to be displayed. By default, if no value is supplied for X, soft limits will be displayed. However if a process is already running, it may have a different ulimit configurations than the current shell that you run the ulimit -a command in.




How are ulimts set? Soft vs. Hard limits Soft limits are the current setting for a particular limit. They can be increased only to the current hard limit setting. 

Hard limits are the maximum limit that can be configured. Any changes to these require root access. 

 

Temporary Settings (for current session) 

 * 
 * ulimit -[H|S]limit_name limit_value


Temporary settings are set via the command line using the ulimit command. The limit_name must be present in the command (see the chart below). These settings are only temporary for the current session and will be lost once the session is over or the terminal window is closed. 

This syntax can be used within shell scripts. Any processes spawned from these shell scripts will also have the temporary settings for the lifetime they are running. 

By default, the soft limit will be changed (as changing the hard limit needs root access). Use -H (for hard limits) or -S (for soft limits) to change specific hard or soft limits. 

NOTES: 

On HP-UX, if you receive an error when setting a particular limit, and you have altered that particular hard limit, you may need to check and see if it had exceeded the kernel parameters. You can use kctune to check (and alter) these if necessary; check your HP-UX documentation for more information. 

For Solaris, settings in the "/etc/system" configuration file also allow configuring of some kernel-wide limits. 

 

Global Settings 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21469413&amp;aid=1] Any changes to these global configuration limits files should be performed by your system administrator. Instructions on how to edit the files can be found on the manpage or in the commented section of the configuration file, as they can vary between versions of UNIX or Linux. 

 

The format of the file, which differs slightly on versions of AIX and Linux, allows individual limits per users or groups, as well as set hard and soft limits. The limits defined in this configuration file are set globally. 

 

Changes made to any limits file take effect after launching a new login shell (such as bash -l), or if the user logs out and logs back in to the system. 

 

NOTES: 

On Solaris and HP-UX, changes made to your shell's profile configuration (.profile or .login) should also take effect on the next login shell launched, or when your user logs back in using the specific shell. 

For kernel-wide settings, which usually require a restart of the operating system to take effect, HP-UX has the kctune command, while Solaris has the /etc/system configuration file. 

 

Specifics for each Operating System:
The most up-to-date information on the limits can be found in the man page for "ulimit".



AIX 
Global settings are generally set in the file /etc/security/limits, although there may be different limit files for LPARs and WPARs. 

 

Please note that this table may not represent all ulimit items as they can vary between operating system versions. Consult the ulimit man page or the limits file for further information.



Command Line limit_name * /etc/security/limits Description ulimit -c [value] core
core_hard Core file size in 512 byte blocks. ulimit -d [value]
(K bytes) data
data_hard Data segment size of processes in kilobytes. ulimit -f [value] fsize
fsize_hard File size limit in 512 byes blocks. ulimit -n [value] nofiles
nofiles_hard Max number of open files and/or sockets per process. ulimit -m [value]
(K bytes) rss
rss_hard The memory size of the process in kilobytes. ulimit -r [value] threads
threads_hard Max number of threads per process. ulimit -s [value]
(K bytes) stack
stack_hard The stack segment size in kilobytes. ulimit -t [value]
(seconds) cpu
cpu_hard Max per process CPU time (in seconds). ulimit -u [value] nproc
nproc_hard Specifies the limit of the number of processes per user. * Values are in 512 byte blocks unless otherwise specified, check your man page for further information 


HP-UX 

There is no global settings file on HP-UX. Instead, you would need to issue the specific ulimit command in your shell's (or user's) profile configuration (like .profile or .login). 

There are similar kernel settings you can also set with kctune, such as "maxfiles_lim", but these kernel parameters do not normally need to be changed. Please refer to its man page for further information. 
Please note that this table may not represent all ulimit items as they can vary between operating system versions. Consult the ulimit man page or your OS documentation for further information.



Command "ulimit" limit_name* Description ulimit -c [value] Core file size in 512 byte blocks. ulimit -d [value] Data segment size of processes in 512 byte blocks. ulimit -f [value] File size limit in 512 byes blocks. ulimit -n [value] Max number of open files and/or sockets per process. ulimit -m [value] The memory size of the process in 512 byte blocks. ulimit -s [value] The stack segment size in 512 byte blocks. ulimit -t [value]
(seconds) Max per process CPU time (in seconds). * Values are in 512 byte blocks unless otherwise specified, check your man page for further information. 


Linux 
Global settings are set in the file /etc/security/limits.conf. 

The format for setting each limit is as follows:
<domain> <type> <item> <value> 

<domain> controls which users or groups will have these limits 

<type> is either the string "soft" or "hard" limits.
The hyphen "-" can also be used which represents both soft and hard limits 

<item> and <value> are shown in the table below. Most values can also use the string unlimited. 

 

Please note that this table may not represent all ulimit items as they can vary between Linux variants. Consult the ulimit man page or the limits.conf file for further information.



Command Line limit_name /etc/security/limits.conf <item> Description ulimit -c [value] core Max core dump file size (KB) ulimit -d [value] data Max data size (KB) ulimit -f [value] fsize Max file size (KB) ulimit -l [value] memlock Max size of address space that can be locked into memory (KB) ulimit -n [value] nofile Max number of open files/sockets per process** ulimit -u [value] nproc Max number of processes for a single user ulimit -m [value] rss Max resident set size (KB) ulimit -s [value] stack The maximum stack size (KB) ulimit -t [value] cpu Max CPU time (minutes or seconds) ** There is a restriction that occurs on Red Hat Enterprise Linux that this value cannot be set to unlimited 







Solaris 

There is no global settings file specifically for ulimits on Solaris (however you can set kernel-wide settings in the /etc/system file). Instead, you would need to issue the specific ulimit command in your shell's (or user's) profile configuration (like .profile or .login). 

Also depending on the shell used, the ulimit command is slightly different. See the man page for further information. 

You can also set kernel wide settings for many of these ulimits in the /etc/system file. 
For example, "set lim_fd_max = [value]" and "set rlim_fd_cur = [value]" are respectively the global hard and soft file descriptor limits. See the system OS's documentation for information on the /etc/system file. 
Please note that this table may not represent all ulimit items as they can vary between operating system versions. Consult the ulimit man page or your OS documentation for further information.

If I am experiencing Too Many Open Files (Unix Error Code 24), can I increase the number of file descriptors? 
Yes you can through the ulimit -n [value] command. However these settings won't take effect until you restart your application server (and nodeagent), making sure you restart on the same command line where you executed "ulimit -n". 

However, if you increase the value high enough and still run into these errors, you may want to check for a file descriptor leak (meaning a leak of opened files and/or sockets in your application code). The command lsof, offered on a variety of operating systems, can provide information on the quantity and types of file descriptors in use. 

Further information can be found at this link: Too Many Open Files error message [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21067352] 


On Linux, can I set the ulimit for the number of open files to unlimited? Certain versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux do not allow this value to be set to unlimited due to a known issue in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=507159]. The limit must be set to an integer value no larger than 1048576. Other versions of Linux may not have this restriction. In the Information Center for WebSphere Application Server, there is a recommendation [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSAW57_8.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/info/ae/ae/tprf_tunelinux.html] of 8000. 

If an attempt is made to set this ulimit to unlimited via the command line, an error will be displayed, and the old value will remain in place:
[root] # ulimit -n unlimited
bash: ulimit: open files: cannot modify limit: Operation not permitted


 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21469413&amp;aid=2] If you try to edit the /etc/security/limits.conf file to force unlimited for the number of open files, this will still be considered invalid and it will be reset to 0. This will prevent any new processes from spawning by that user or group. If this is the root user, the system will slowly die as new processes will be unable to generate. A recovery disc will be needed to reset the value. 




On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, why are my settings for nproc (ulimit -u) not being honored. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 has introduced a configuration file, addressed in a bug report [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=919793], ( /etc/security/limits.d/90-nproc.conf ) that overrides the nproc setting in the limits.conf. This file contains a line for nproc configured with a soft limit of 1024. 

* soft nproc 1024 

The rationale for this was to prevent fork bombs from occurring, To keep using the limits.conf for your nproc ulimit settings, you would need to comment this line out by making the first character on the line a hash/pound symbol. 

#* soft nproc 1024 
 

I am using an /etc/init.d script (or inittab) to start my application server and setting the global ulimit settings had no effect? The global settings for ulimit will not take effect if the init process starts the application server or nodeagent because it has yet to load the global settings. The global settings take effect once a login terminal session is started, or when a user logs in to the system, not when the init process spawns new processes based on init.d scripts. At startup, the operating system hasn't begun to load specific profiles up, even the root user. When you see individual services and processes starting, these are all child processes of the init process 

This was previously documented for AIX 6.1 in the following Knowledge Center article entitled "telinit or init Command", under the Environments section. Here's the quoted section: 

"A command that is executed by init from the /etc/inittab file uses init's ulimit values and not the default values as given in /etc/security/limits. The result is that a command that is successfully executed from the command line may not execute correctly when invoked by init. Any command that has specific ulimit requirements should include specific actions to set the ulimit values as required."

 IBM Deletion of virtual portal fails with transaction timeout - United States virtual portal; timeout; delete; portlet; EJPAH4000E; EJPEB0804E; rollbackexception; admin; WTRN0006W TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
Attempt to delete virtual portal via Virtual Portal Manager portlet fails with error:

EJPAH4000E: Failed to delete virtual portal 

Attempts to delete the virtual portal using the ConfigEngine task "delete-virtual-portal" may fail as well.


CAUSE
With the introduction of Managed Pages in WebSphere Portal 8.0, virtual portal deletions require more transaction time when removing from the system. This increased transaction time can lead to an error situation if either of the following timeouts is exceeded: 

 * the total and/or maximum transaction lifetime timeout value(s) for the server 
 * the WCM component's transaction timeout

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
SystemOut.log may show the following: 

Example #1:

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1. Increase the total transaction lifetime timeout and maximum transaction timeout values (for example, to 600 seconds or greater) using the instructions in the Related information section below. 

2. If the problem persists after addressing the change in suggestion #1 and the error in SystemOut.log shows that the timeout still occurs after 120 seconds (as opposed to the increased value that you just set), then update to Cumulative Fix (CF) 9 or later to get the fix for APAR PI04872 and then add (or update if already exists) the following custom property to the WCM_WCMConfigService Resource Environment Provider: 

Name: wcm.transaction.timeout 

Value: 600 (for example) 

Note: There is not a target value for a transaction timeouts that applies to every customer environment. The goal should be to find a value that allows the virtual portal deletion to succeed but does not introduce significant delay in being alerted for other transaction timeouts.

The following problems are addressed by this fix.

2.1 APARs
---------------
None.

2.2 Defects
-----------
Defect: 210286
Abstract: Update model for VM PARTITION
Additional information: For "Free_Space" and "Used_Space" attributes, the
default aggregation is defined not as AVG but as SUM. It usually
works as expected but if there were two entries which have same
"Timestamp", the "VM_PARTITION" attribute group's data is shown
with doubled values.
Defect: 212729
Abstract: Drill through feature is not working in VE 7.2 FP2 reports
Additional information: A few VMware VI reports are showing the following
message, when we try drill through by clicking on report chart:
RSV-CM-0005 Content Manager did not return an object for the
requested search path.
Defect: 212776
Abstract: Datacenter parameter/prompt is missing in a few VM reports
Additional information: The Datacenter parameter/prompt is missing in the
following VMware VI reports: VM Heat Chart, Bottom N VMs by
Resource Pool and Top N VMs By Resource Pool.
Defect: 212851
Abstract: Place Date range parameter after the Resource prompts
Additional information: A few VMware VI reports contain time selection over
resource selection. Therefore to make uniformity across the reports,
place Date range parameter after the resource prompts (like Data
Center and Cluster).
Defect: 212924
Abstract: Unsorted resources e.g.Cluster on parameter selection page
Additional information: Most of the VMware VI reports sometimes display 
unsorted resources (viz. Data Center, Cluster, Host Servers, VMs
etc.) on parameter selection (aka prompt) page.
Defect: 212925
Abstract: Incorrect caption/label for Host Server resource parameter
Additional information: Incorrect caption/label for the resource parameter
e.g. In Network usage by VMs report, the "Host Server(s)" drop
down list title needs to be corrected as "Host Server" as user
can select only one host in this report.

2.3 Enhancements
------------------
Feature: 210245
Abstract: Enhance model to add SAMPLES.
Additional information: Add SAMPLES query item/column for each summarized
attribute group view (viz. Hourly, Daily, Weekly and Monthly)
in existing VMware VI Agent reports data model.
Feature: 213018
Abstract: RFE 60331: Require a new report for Cluster Utilization Details
Additional information: Require a new cluster level report like the Host 
Server Utilization Details report, which is useful and included the
actual data points from the graph at the bottom of the report.
Defect: 213084
Abstract: Provide a choice to select date range or start & end week
Additional information: Provide a parameter choice (aka date filter option)
to either select date range or start and end week of the year in
the following VMware VI reports: Cluster Weekly Comparison and
Host Servers Weekly Comparison.

 IBM JDBC driver or database insufficiencies cause administration portlets to fail. - United States RT0002E; JDBC; database; driver; RepositoryException; PLS; EJPAS0017E TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
You attempt to create a new page via the Manage Pages portlet or add a portlet to a page via the Edit Layout portlet and encounter an error.

SYMPTOM
SystemOut.log contains:
... DefaultTransa E Message: Could not save object in repository., 
Cause: javax.jcr.RepositoryException: RT0002E: Error while calling a function createItems of PLS data manager
com.ibm.workplace.wcm.services.repository.RepositoryException: 
Message: Could not save object in repository., Cause: javax.jcr.RepositoryException: RT0002E: Error while calling a function createItems of PLS data manager
...
Caused by: com.ibm.icm.da.DBAccessException:
java.sql.SQLFeatureNotSupportedException:DSRA1300E: Feature is not implemented: PreparedStatement.setBinaryStream
at com.ibm.icm.da.portable.data.WideTableData.changeItems(WideTableData.java:857) 

 

The client browser displays: 


EJPAS0017E ... Message: Could not save object in repository.,
Cause: javax.jcr.RepositoryException: RT0002E: Error while calling a
function createItems of PLS data ...

or:

EJPAE0015E: Failed to add new portlets.
...
EJPEC0002E: The transaction has been set to rollback state...


CAUSE
The JDBC driver does not meet WebSphere Portal v8's prerequisites.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check SystemOut.log for the database server version and JDBC driver version: 


DSRA8204I: Database product version : ...
InternalGener I DSRA8205I: JDBC driver name : ...
InternalGener I DSRA8206I: JDBC driver version : ...

Compare these to WebSphere Portal v8's prerequisites. Refer to the WebSphere Portal V8.0 detailed system requirements link below.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If the database server and/or JDBC driver do not meet WebSphere Portal v8's prerequisites, upgrade or downgrade the component(s) to the appropriate supported level(s) and restart the Portal server(s). 

 

If upgrading the JDBC driver requires replacing the .jar with another differently named .jar, other components in the system that referenced the older .jar may be affected. Pay special consideration to: 


WAS Integrated Solutions Console > Environment > WebSphere Variables
VMM_JDBC_CLASSPATH
ORACLE_JDBC_DRIVER_PATH

These are stored in: <profile>/config/cells/<cell name>/variables.xml

Other WebSphere variables may also reference the older .jar, or these same variables may be set in different scopes, so check other variables and variables.xml files as well, such as: <profile>/config/cells/<cell name>/nodes/<node name>/variables.xml

 IBM How Connect TDWC 9.3 to TWS Engine lower level release - United States dwc 93; connect; SSL ; TLS TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 DWC 9.3 users cannot connect to TWS Engine lower level releases (8.5.1 until 9.2) 

SYMPTOM
Unable to connect to TWS 8.5.1 ,8.6 or 9.1/9.2 from DWC 9.3. 

Check the WAS SystemOut.log for error :

SSL0080E: javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException - The client and server could not negotiate the desired level of security. Reason: Server chose SSLv3, 
but that protocol version is not enabled or not supported by the client. javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Server chose SSLv3, but that protocol version is not enabled or not supported by the client.


CAUSE
DWC 9.3 is packaged with WAS 8.5.5.4 and due to known vulnerabilities has SSLV3 disabled. However TWS 9.2 and earlier versions use SSLv3 by default and so the DWC 9.3 cannot connect


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You can solve this problem by configuring your TWS engines to use TLS instead of SSL :


Backup and edit : 

TWA_HOME/WAS/TWSProfile/config/cells/TWSNodeCell/security.xml 

Find sslProtocol and change "SSL_TLS" to "TLS" 

Find ssl.protocol and change value="SSL" to value="TLS" 

Backup and edit : 

TWA_HOME/WAS/TWSProfile/properties/ssl.client.props 

Find com.ibm.ssl.protocol=SSL and change to com.ibm.ssl.protocol=TLS 

Backup and edit : 

TWA_HOME/WAS/TWSProfile/temp/ssl.client.props 

Find com.ibm.ssl.protocol=SSL and change to com.ibm.ssl.protocol=TLS 

Stop and restart WAS. 

*Be aware that your Engines are now using TLS and so you must also reconfigure any DWC 9.2 or 9.1 installations that need to connect to those engines. You would change them to use TLS in the same way as above but also by the same changes in these copies of security.xml and ssl.client.props : 

TWA_HOME/JazzSM/profile/config/cells/JazzSMNode01Cell/security.xml 

TWA_HOME/JazzSM/profile/properties/ssl.client.props 

TWA_HOME/JazzSM/profile/temp/ssl.client.props 

Please consider that since you configure with TLS the WAS of TWS Engine also the Dynamic Agent can be impacted.

 IBM Automatically renew trusted credential - United States security; trusted credentials SSO renew TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I choose the value to use for the Security > Authentication > Automatically renew trusted credential setting? 

ANSWER
For IBM Cognos Business Intelligence(BI) deployments that do not implement a single sign-on (SSO) solution, stored credentials used for running scheduled activities can be automatically updated. When a user logs into the IBM Cognos BI application with a user name and password, the trusted credential used to run schedules when not logged in will be refreshed as well. This removes the burden from the end user of having to remember to manually refresh their trusted credentials and may eliminate failed activities caused by changed or expired user credentials.
The credential refresh behaviour is controlled by the Security > Authentication > Automatically renew trusted credential setting in Cognos Configuration.


 * Primary namespace only (default setting): When you log on to the first namespace of your session, if you have trusted credentials for that account, the credentials are updated for the primary account only. All other credentials for other namespaces are not updated.
   
 * Off: Credentials are not updated in any namespace.
   
 * All namespaces: When you log on to the first namespace, your credentials are updated as described for "Primary namespace only". When you log on to additional namespaces, if your trusted credentials associated with the primary account contain logon information for that namespace, then those trusted credentials are updated. NOTE: Do not use the All namespaces option if users authenticate into secondary namespaces as different users.


A user's trusted credentials for a namespace will only be renewed once per day. 

It is NOT possible to use SSO with the feature 'Automatically Renew Trusted Credentials' found in Cognos BI. The reason for this is due to the following: 

"A trusted credential is special because the namespace credentials it stores must be usable at any time, not depending on any timestamp. This rules out SSO tickets like Kerberos tokens or SAP tokens as they will expire after a short time and will become unusable. A suitable trusted credential therefore usually is a pair consisting of a user name and a password. However, for SSO based authentication to IBM Cognos BI, there is no password available to the namespace that can be stored into the trusted credential. Therefore, this feature will only work for basic authentication, when the user provides a user name and password to the login screen." RELATED INFORMATION

 IBM How to Rollback From a Fix Pack or Interim Fix to an Earlier Build - United States uninstall; revert; downgrade; hotsite; HS; out; fixpack TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 There may be times when there is a need to remove a previously installed Fix Pack or Interim Fix (hotsite) and revert to the original installed version. This document describes how to roll back an installed Fix Pack or Interim Fix applied to Cognos BI. 

ANSWER
Assuming create backup was selected, there will be a folder with the backup under the uninstall directory. Use these files to roll back. In version 10.2.1 FP1 and above there is no option to create a backup, instead backups are automatically created in the <cognos_install>/bkp directory.
Note that the backup directories only contain copies of all individual files that were modified by the fix pack or interim fix, not the entire contents of the original directory.

Care must also be taken when removing interim fixes to ensure that there weren't later interim fixes applied which also contain some of the same files. It is recommended that a full system and content store backup be performed before attempting.

Steps: 



 1. Stop the Cognos service and ensure that Cognos Configuration is not running. 
 2. When setting up the configuration of a newly installed Cognos BI environment, it is important to note that if you configure the new installation against the original content store, it is permanently upgraded to the new version and can no longer be used in the original environment. As a result, always create a backup of the content store prior to upgrading.
    If a roll back to the original version is required, you can simply restore the backup. However, any work done after the content store has been upgraded (reports, models, security, etc...) to the new version will be lost, as all of this information is saved in the content store.
    If you try to revert back to an earlier environment configured against the upgraded content store, you will get an error similar to the one below:
    CM-CFG-5027 Unable to upgrade the content store to the to the version N that is compatible with this version of Content Manager. The current version of the content store is M. 
 3. Also, please refer to the notes on the fix pack which would include perquisites on Backup/Restore of content store and also other requirements. 
 4. For versions 8 - 10.2.1: In the <cognos_install>/uninstall/backup directory there will be a list of date stamped folders with the applied fix packs and/or interim fixes. 
    For versions 10.2.1 FP1 and above: This is stored in the <cognos_install>/bkp directory 
 5. Go into the folders and check the cmplst.txt file and check for the correct version to revert to. 
 6. Once the correct version is found, copy the contents of the whole folder and paste it at the <cognos_install> level, which will overwrite the files applied by fix pack or interim fix update. 
 7. Start the Cognos service.

 IBM Using -Xgc:preferredHeapBase with -Xcompressedrefs - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 "Why does the JVM report a native out-of-memory (NOOM) when using compressed references? I am using a 64bit JVM and I clearly have plenty of memory left. How can I resolve this problem?" 

CAUSE
 

*In this note, please refer to Java Versioning: Java Version.Release.ServiceRelease.FixPack 
ex: Java 7.1.4.6 is the same as Java 7.1 SR4 FP6 is the same as Java 7 R1 SR4 FP6. 
The IBM JVM will automatically use compressed references [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/understanding/mm_compressed_references.html]when using a maximum heap size less than 25GB. This automated behavior was introduced in Java 6.1.5.0 and Java 7.0.4.0*. Compressed references (CR) decreases the size of Java objects making better use of available memory space. This better use of space results in improved JVM performance. *(Java 7.0.1.1 and later uses compressed references by default on z/OS) 

See Introducing WebSphere Compressed Reference Technology [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/webserver/appserv/was/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf] for detailed information on how Compressed References work. 

"When using compressed references, the size of the field used in the Java object for the Class Pointer and the Monitor/Lock is 32 bits instead of the 64bits that would be available in non-compressed mode. Because we are using 32 bits to store the location of these, and they are located in native (non-Java heap) memory, they must be allocated in the first 4GB of the address space - the maximum range we can address with the 32 bits." ~IBM Java Development Team 

If the Java heap itself is small (-Xmx), the JVM may allocate it in the lower 4GB of address space along with the Class Pointers and Monitors/Locks. If these Class Pointers, Monitors/Locks and Java heap (if included) cannot fit in the lower 4GB, a native out of memory (NOOM) [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-nativememory-linux/] will be thrown. 
ANSWER
Why Use Compressed References? 

Below the 4GB mark, the JVM does not have to perform any compression/decompression of the address pointer at runtime. Therefore, the best performance will be attained if the Class Pointers, Monitors/Locks and Java heap can all be contained comfortably within the lowest 4GB of the address space. 

 

Determining Address Location of Java Heap Memory 

To verify if the Java heap has memory regions below the 4GB mark, check the "Object Memory" section in the javacore:

Convert the "start" address from the hex value to a GB value [http://ss64.com/convert.html]. In the example below, 0x000000000F010000=0.23GB which is below the the 4GB (0x0000000100000000) mark.



 * [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890&amp;aid=1]


Setting the Preferred Heap Base with -Xgc:preferredHeapBase 

Starting with Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0, and later, the JVM will determine if the Java heap will fit comfortably in the lower 4GB. If it is too large, the JVM will automatically allocate the Java heap above the 4GB mark (APAR IV37797 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV37797]). 



NOTE: In IBM System z platforms (i.e. z/OS and z/Linux), automatic shift of the heap above the 4GB address space does NOT occur because on these platforms, there is an additional performance penalty 
associated with higher shift values. To resolve Native OOM issues due to a shortage of heap memory in the lower region on z platforms, use -Xnocompressedrefs (see below). 
See related: IBM Knowledge Center - JVMJ9GC089W [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_7.0.0/com.ibm.java.messages/diag/appendixes/messages/j9gc/message_jvmj9gc089.html] However, in earlier Java 6.1 and Java 7.0 versions (earlier than Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0), if the Java heap can not fit in the lower 4GB, a NOOM will occur. To avoid this problem, the generic JVM argument [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21417365] -Xgc:preferredHeapBase=<address> [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/understanding/mm_compressed_references.html] can be used to ensure the Java heap is allocated above the 4GB address space. This will leave more room for the Class Pointer and Monitor/Lock memory. 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * This will locate the Java heap starting at the 4GB mark thus leaving the lower 4GB for the other processes.


Increase Maximum Heap Size to Force Heap Allocation Above the 4GB mark 

Another way to ensure that the heap is allocated above the 4GB mark (Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0 and later) is to set a maximum heap size equal to or greater than 4GB. For example -Xmx4G will ensure that the heap will have to be allocated above the 4GB mark. This will not work in earlier versions of the JVM since these earlier versions allowed the heap to straddle the 4GB mark, placing part of the memory above and some below (fixed as part of APAR IV37797) . 

 

Further Investigation 

If after setting -Xgc:preferredHeapBase=<address> or -Xmx4G a NOOM is still encountered (Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0 and later), then further investigation is required at the application level. Look to decrease the size and usage of the applications Class Pointers and Monitors/Locks. Additionally, there are some WebSphere Application Server troubleshooting methods that may help reduce the native memory footprint. See: IBM Troubleshooting native memory issues [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg21373312].

Reserving Low-Memory Space with -Xmcrs

If there is still free memory in the system when a Native OutOfMemory (NOOM) occurs, then the problem may be a shortage of memory in the low-memory region (under 4GB). Even if the Java heap is located above this boundary, other data associated with Java objects can be located in the low-memory region.

The OS memory allocator will deal out low-memory freely, thus memory resources in the lower boundary may run out. Later when the JVM tries to allocate memory for an artifact which is required to be allocated in low-memory (because the JVM has only reserved a 32bit pointer for it) it fails and throws an OutOfMemoryError.

Starting in Java 6.0.16.3, Java 6.1.8.3, Java 7.0.8.10, Java 7.1.2.10, there is a parameter -Xmcrs [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_6.0.0/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/appendixes/cmdline/xmcrs.html] which allows the JVM to increase the amount of low memory it reserves on startup. With this setting, as long as the low-memory usage by the JVM does not exceed the -Xmcrs value, NOOM in the lower boundary will be avoided.

To set this parameter, first decide what a reasonable value for your lower memory requirements may be. Reasonable value is unique to each environment so there is not a general recommendation.


 * -Xmcrs<reasonable_value_for_lower_memory>

 * 


Disabling Compressed References with -Xnocompressedrefs As a last resort, if the native memory still can not be contained under the 4GB mark, you can set -Xnocompressedrefs [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/appendixes/cmdline/Xnocompressedrefs.html] as a generic JVM argument. [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21417365] Using -Xnocompressedrefs will remove the use of compressed references and therefore remove the lower 4GB memory restriction on the Class Pointers and Monitors/Locks. This will however, result in a significant increase in Java heap memory requirements. It is not uncommon for 70% more heap space to be required. Due to the increased memory requirements it is strongly advised that the Java heap size is adjusted to a larger value and garbage collection is monitored and retuned as required.

Additionally, some benchmarks show a 10-20% relative throughput decrease when disabling compressed references: "Analysis shows that a 64-bit application without CR yields only 80-85% of 32-bit throughput but with CR yields 90-95%. Depending on application requirements, CR can improve performance up to 20% over standard 64-bit." See:ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/webserver/appserv/was/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/webserver/appserv/was/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf].

Before using -Xnocompressedrefs as a solution, first rule out the possibility of a native memory leak. Since using -Xnocompressedrefs will allow the the native memory to grow unbounded, a leak in native memory will lead to process size growth eventually leading to a process that needs to be paged out. The paging will incur performance overhead which will eventually lead to an unstable environment. Therefore careful consideration must be used when selecting -Xnocompressedrefs as a solution.


Memory Map Considerations 

The below figure is a generalization of how the JVM handles addresses in each section of the memory map based on heap size and compressed references (CR). Please note that at each stage beyond having all of the Java memory contained below the 4GB mark, there will be performance consequences: 



[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890&amp;aid=3] 

No Compressed References Overhead using -Xnocompressedrefs 
or
-Xmx > 25GB -increased memory footprint
-fewer/larger objects stored on heap leads to more frequent GC
-lower cache and translation look aside buffer (TLB) utilization [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890&amp;aid=4] Compressed References Overhead maximum heap address used by the Java JVM process is below 4GB none maximum heap address used by the Java JVM process is above 4GB but below 32GB compression/decompression of address pointers 


Getting Assistance From IBM Support 
If further assistance will be required from IBM WebSphere Support, please set the following -Xdump [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/tools/dumpagents_syntax.html] parameters in the generic JVM arguments [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21417365]: 
 * 
 * 
 * 


Then restart the JVM and recreate the problem. Once the NOOM is encountered, process the resulting system core with jextract [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21577379]. Send the jextracted core file, heapdump, javacore, snap trace, systemOut.log, native_stderr.log, native_stdout.log and systemErr.log to IBM Support [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21153852] for further analysis.

 IBM Installation Manager does not work if symbolic links are used for Installation Manager of installed product locations - United States RN1.5; RN1.5.1; RN1.5.0.1; RN1.5.2; RN1.5.3; RN1.6; RN1.6.1; RN1.6.2; RN1.6.3; RN1.6.3.1; RN1.7; RN1.7.1; RN1.7.2; SRX; 1628092; RATLC02668456; IPL; Symlink TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You install IBM Installation Manager by using symbolic links at the root level for the agent data location or the installation location or for both locations and after a system change or system restart you cannot start Installation Manager or you cannot use Installation Manager to update or uninstall products. 

CAUSE
When you install Installation Manager, the values for the agent data directory, the Installation Manager binaries, and the installation directories for products are stored internally as absolute paths with all the symbolic links resolved. If a symbolic link is used as part of the path for any of these directories or binaries, the symbolic link is replaced with its target value.
Similarly, when a product is installed with Installation Manager, the values for the installation location and shared resources directory are stored internally as absolute paths with all symbolic links resolved. 

If the symbolic links change their values, the absolute path names for directories that are used by Installation Manager might change. When the Installation Manager starts, it will initialize itself using the data in the agent data location. However, the stored values for the paths to the agent data directory, Installation Manager binaries, or product installation locations do not point to the new locations. Installation Manager might fail to start, or might be unable to update or uninstall products that are installed.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
When choosing locations for the agent data directory, the Installation Manager binaries, shared resources directory, and the installation directories for products, do not use paths that include symbolic links. 


If Installation Manager is using paths that no longer exist, create the old paths manually and mount the affected file systems at the original locations that are used by Installation Manager. Verify that the user IDs for Installation Manager have read access to each level of the recreated paths.

Locate the WP PumaStoreService Resource Environment Provider in resources.xml and confirm if there is a defined property name for store.puma_default.user.fbadefault.filter. If not, then the default and active value for such property is "uid". If it does exist, then verify the attribute defined for the value. Then check the LDIF export for the user to confirm if such attribute is defined. 
RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Create/update the store.puma_default.user.fbadefault.filter custom property for the WP PumaStoreService Resource Environment Provider via the Integrated Solutions Console to an attribute that exists for all Portal users in the backend user registry (for example, "cn").

 IBM Pdcollect tool for ITM IBM i OS agent - United States ITM_TEMA_DIST_CONFIGURATION ITM_i5_Agent 5724C04 A4 OS/400 i5/OS IBMi IBM i pdcollect TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I collect logs and files for the IBM i OS agent? 

ANSWER
The pdcollect tool for the IBM i OS agent allows you to easily and quickly collect the most commonly used information from an IBM i system for IBM Support to investigate a problem. The tool gathers log files, configuration information, version information, job information, message queue information, and basic system information. 

Pdcollect is delivered in the IBM i OS agent beginning in ITM 6.23 FP5 and ITM 6.30 FP3. It is located in the following IFS directory: 


/QIBM/ProdData/IBM/ITM/bin/pdcollect.sh


Pdcollect is also available as a downloadable file which is stored in an IFS directory chosen by the user. Download the following zip file to a local workstation and extract its contents. Follow the instructions in readme.txt for further information on installing the tool. 

 pdcollect_ibmi_1.4.zip [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21657023&aid=2]pdcollect_ibmi_1.4.zip [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21657023&aid=1] 

 The tool is executed by issuing the following shell script command in Qshell:

<directory>/pdcollect.sh 

where <directory> is the IFS directory where the tool is stored. 

You must execute pdcollect while running under a user profile that you use to run IBM Tivoli Monitoring to avoid problems with object authorities. 

The output from the tool is a single compressed file that can be sent in binary form to IBM Support if requested. The output file is stored at the following location: 

 /tmp/ITM/pdcollect_ibmi.tar.Z 

The output file is overwritten each time the tool is run. Copy or rename the output file after each invocation if more than one data collection is needed. 

Instructions to view the data that has been collected is displayed in a message at the end of pdcollect processing. 

The pdcollect tool for the IBM i OS agent does not collect information from the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server (TEMS) or Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server (TEPS) systems. You may be asked to collect additional information from your TEMS or TEPS systems separately.

 IBM IV67523 Move local data from CANDLEHOME to another file system - United States 6.30.05.00 CANDLEHOME CANDLEDATA itmCANDLEDATA.sh TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I move local data such as configuration files, log files, historical data, etc. from CANDLEHOME to a different file system? 

CAUSE
Since its inception, IBM Tivoli Monitoring (ITM) has stored local data such as configuration files, log files, and historical data together with the installation files in CANDLEHOME. For example, ITM normally installs in a directory named /opt/IBM/ITM. Within that directory, it stores programs in subdirectory names like /opt/IBM/ITM/bin and /opt/IBM/ITM/classes. It also stores local data in subdirectory names like /opt/IBM/ITM/config and /opt/IBM/ITM/logs. This homogeneous design is a problem for installations that require an approach that keeps code in /opt and stores data in the /var file system.

ANSWER
Introduction 

Under APAR IV67523, ITM added a new mechanism to move local data to a different file system. For example, data typically stored in /opt/IBM/ITM/config and /opt/IBM/ITM/logs can be redirected to /var/IBM/ITM/config and /var/IBM/ITM/logs. This new file system location is designated by the user at installation time, and it is referred to as CANDLEDATA. A conversion utility is provided to implement CANDLEDATA for existing installations. 

The CANDLEDATA mechanism is available with ITM 6.30.05.00. 

 






How CANDLEDATA Works 

The CANDLEDATA mechanism is implemented primarily using symbolic links. This means most of the underlying code in ITM is unaware of CANDLEDATA. This also means the CANDLEDATA mechanism is limited to Linux and UNIX platforms. 

The rest of this section shows examples of links where CANDLEHOME=/opt/IBM/ITM and CANDLEDATA=/var/IBM/ITM. You can define different locations for your own installation. 

 

Base Directory Links 

The following local data directories are always linked from CANDLEHOME to CANDLEDATA:


 * /opt/IBM/ITM/InstallITM -> /var/IBM/ITM/InstallITM
 * 
 * /opt/IBM/ITM/config -> /var/IBM/ITM/config
 * 
 * /opt/IBM/ITM/kt1v3depot -> /var/IBM/ITM/kt1v3depot
 * 
 * /opt/IBM/ITM/localconfig -> /var/IBM/ITM/localconfig
 * 
 * /opt/IBM/ITM/logs -> /var/IBM/ITM/logs
 * 
 * /opt/IBM/ITM/patchlogs -> /var/IBM/ITM/patchlogs
 * 
 * /opt/IBM/ITM/tables -> /var/IBM/ITM/tables
 * 
 * /opt/IBM/ITM/tmaitm6/agentdepot -> /var/IBM/ITM/tmaitm6/agentdepot
 * 
 * /opt/IBM/ITM/tmp -> /var/IBM/ITM/tmp

These directories and links are automatically generated by ITM when the system is installed or converted to use CANDLEDATA. 

 

General Agent Directory Links 

In addition to the base set of directory links, most agents have general links for TEMA data:


 * /opt/IBM/ITM/ATTRLIB -> /var/IBM/ITM/ATTRLIB
 * 
 * /opt/IBM/ITM/<platform>/<pc>/tables/ATTRLIB -> /var/IBM/ITM/ATTRLIB/<pc>
 * 
 * /opt/IBM/ITM/EIFLIB -> /var/IBM/ITM/EIFLIB
 * 
 * /opt/IBM/ITM/<platform>/<pc>/tables/EIFLIB -> /var/IBM/ITM/EIFLIB/<pc>
 * 
 * /opt/IBM/ITM/hist -> /var/IBM/ITM/hist
 * 
 * /opt/IBM/ITM/<platform>/<pc>/hist -> /var/IBM/ITM/hist/<pc>
 * 
 * /opt/IBM/ITM/psit -> /var/IBM/ITM/psit
 * 
 * /opt/IBM/ITM/<platform>/<pc>/psit -> /var/IBM/ITM/psit/<pc>


These directories and links are automatically generated by ITM when the agent is converted to use CANDLEDATA.  

Special Agent Directory Links 

Some agents have links that are specific to that agent. For example, the LZ and UX agents create the following link for the Watchdog component to store local data:


 * /opt/IBM/ITM/kca -> /var/IBM/ITM/kca


These directories and links are automatically generated by ITM when the agent is converted to use CANDLEDATA.  

CANDLEDATA <-> CANDLEHOME Directory Links 

The CANDLEHOME and CANDLEDATA directories also have cross references to each other:


 * /opt/IBM/IBM/registry/CANDLEDATA -> /var/IBM/ITM
 * 
 * /opt/IBM/ITM <- /var/IBM/ITM/CANDLEHOME


These links are all automatically generated by ITM when the system is installed or converted to use CANDLEDATA.  

Configuration Variables exploited by CANDLEDATA 

In addition to symbolic links, some individual components have special configuration settings to redirect agent-specific data to CANDLEDATA. ITM redirects data using the following configuration variables:


 * CTIRA_SIT_PATH
 * 
 * CANDLEHOME/
 * <platform>/<pc>/psit
 * 
 * 
 * KCA_IP_DIR
 * 
 * CANDLEHOME/kca
 * 
 * 
 * KCAWD_WRITE_DIR 
 * 
 * CANDLEHOME/kca
 * 
 * 

Notes:  1. While the variables point to CANDLEHOME/xxx, the directory links cause the local data to be written to the corresponding CANDLEDATA/xxx. 
 2. If you use configuration overrides that set these configuration variables, you'll need to review how those overrides work in an environment configured to use CANDLEDATA. In most cases, you'll want to remove your overrides.


Configuration Variables affected by CANDLEDATA
The symbolic links established by ITM for CANDLEDATA assume standard agent configuration. If you've modified any of the following, data will be continue to be redirected to the location you specified instead of the CANDLEDATA directory:
. 

 * ATTRLIB
 * 
 * CTIRA_HIST_DIR
 * 
 * EIFLIB
 * 
 * 

When converting an existing CANDLEHOME, ITM migrates any data in the original directories before linking them to CANDLEDATA. If you've modified any of the following, you must consider whether you need to change the setting and migrate the data manually: 
.  * CTIRA_SIT_FILE
 * 
 * 

By default, all of the following configuration variables direct data to /opt/IBM/ITM/localconfig. ITM migrates data from /opt/IBM/ITM/localconfig to /var/IBM/ITM/localconfig and then links the two. If you've modified any of these, you must consider whether you need to change the setting and migrate the data manually: 
.  * CTIRA_THRESHOLDS 
 * 
 * IRA_EVENT_EXPORT_SNMP_TRAP_CONFIG
 * 
 * 
 * IRA_LOCALCONFIG_DIR
 * 
 * 
 * IRA_PRIVATE_SITUATION_CONFIG
 * 
 * 
 * IRA_SERVICE_INTERFACE_DEFAULT_PAGE
 * 
 * 
 * IRA_SERVICE_INTERFACE_DIR
 * 
 * 
 * KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_DEFINITIONS 





Known Restrictions


 1.  The CANDLEDATA mechanism is available only for ITM on Linux and UNIX. ITM on Windows continues to keep local data under CANDLEHOME. 
     . 
 2.  No facility is provided switch from a CANDLEHOME+CANDLEDATA implementation back to a unified CANDLEHOME implementation. To do this, you must uninstall and reinstall ITM.
     . 
 3.  No facility is provided to move CANDLEDATA from one directory to another. To do this, you must uninstall and reinstall ITM.
     . 
 4.  The CANDLEHOME and CANDLEDATA arrangement is a 1:1 relationship.  * Only one CANDLEHOME can use a given CANDLEDATA. This means a given CANDLEDATA cannot be shared with multiple CANDLEHOMEs. 
      * A given CANDLEHOME can only use one CANDLEDATA. This means components cannot be split amongst multiple CANDLEDATAs.
        .
     
     
 5.  The monitoring server and portal server cannot exploit CANDLEDATA.  * The conversion utility will not convert an existing CANDLEHOME if it contains the monitoring server or portal server. 
      * The installer warns if CANDLEDATA is specified and the install image contains the monitoring server or portal server. However, the installer does not prevent monitoring server or portal server from being installed. 
      * ITM does not allow the monitoring server to start if CANDLEDATA is implemented. 
      * ITM does not allow the portal server to start if CANDLEDATA is implemented.
        .
     
     
 6.  Not all agents have been verified to work with CANDLEDATA. Before using CANDLEDATA, check with the support group for each of the agents you intend to install.
     . 
 7.  System Monitor Agents (SMA) can exploit CANDLEDATA. However, the SMA installer does not create CANDLEDATA. These agents must be converted to use CANDLEDATA after they are installed.
     . 
 8.  The CANDLEDATA mechanism is intended only for current agents. If the agent media contains installer 6.30.00.00 or above, it should be ok to use with CANDLEDATA. 
     
     Some older or discontinued agents such as the Universal Agent (UM) and UNIX Logs agent (UL) cannot use CANDLEDATA reliably. ITM does not prevent older or discontinued agents from being installed into a new CANDLEHOME with CANDLEDATA implemented. 
     . 
 9.  When CANDLEDATA is in use, ITM implements internal overrides for the following configuration variables: CTIRA_SIT_PATH, KCA_IP_DIR, and KCAWD_WRITE_DIR.  * If you've already overridden any of these configuration variables, you must remove the overrides before converting a given component. 
      * If you've overridden these with CANDLEHOME/config/xx.environment, the conversion utility will detect and warn about them. Your overrides will win, so you must remove them. 
      * If you've overridden these with the old method of sourcing a script into CANDLEHOME/config/xx.ini, the conversion utility cannot detect them. However, the CANDLEDATA overrides will win.
        .
     
     
 10. The prerequisite scanner does not know about CANDLEDATA. It continues to assume everything is stored in CANDLEHOME. This means:  * No space checking is performed for CANDLEDATA. 
      * Results are somewhat inflated for CANDLEHOME.
        .
     
     
 11. The conversion utility does not check for space when converting an existing new CANDLEHOME to use CANDLEDATA. Make sure there is enough space in CANDLEDATA before starting the conversion process. 







Agents Verified with CANDLEDATA

The following agents have been verified to run properly when CANDLEDATA is implemented:


 * LO
 * 
 * 
 * LZ
 * 
 * 
 * UD
 * 
 * 
 * UX
 * 
 * 

For other agents, contact the corresponding support team.  






Setting Up a New Local Installation with CANDLEDATA

For new installations, you can define the location for local data at installation time.

Local install (interactive):


 * 
 * CANDLEDATA
 * 
 * CANDLEHOME
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * # ./install.sh
 * 
 * INSTALL
 * 
 * 
 * Enter the name of the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory.
 * 
 * [ default = /opt/IBM/ITM ]:
 * 
 * "/opt/IBM/ITM" does not exist
 * 
 * Try to create it [ 1-yes, 2-no; "1" is default ]?
 * 
 * Creating directory "/opt/IBM/ITM"...
 * 
 * 
 * Enter the name of the IBM Tivoli Monitoring local data directory.
 * 
 * [ default = /opt/IBM/ITM ]: /var/IBM/ITM
 * 
 * "/var/IBM/ITM" does not exist
 * 
 * Try to create it [ 1-yes, 2-no; "1" is default ]?
 * 
 * Creating directory "/var/IBM/ITM"...
 * 
 * itmCANDLEDATA.sh: Installation directory "/opt/IBM/ITM" successfully converted to use data directory "/var/IBM/ITM".
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * CANDLEDATA
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * CANDLEDATA
 * 
 * CANDLEHOME
 * 
 * CANDLEDATA
 * 
 * CANDLEHOME
 * 
 * CANDLEHOME
 * 


Local install (silent): 
 * 
 * CANDLEDATA
 * 
 * CANDLEDATA
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * install.sh 
   [-l 
 * CANDLEDATA
 * ] 
 *  
   Where:  * -l
    * 
    * CANDLEHOME
    * 
   
   
 * 
 * 
 * CANDLEDATA
 * 
 * install.sh
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * CANDLEDATA
 * 
 * CANDLEHOME
 * 
 * CANDLEDATA
 * 
 * install.sh
 * 







Starting an agent for the first time with CANDLEDATA 

When you specify CANDLEDATA at install time, ITM establishes the base directory links. All agent-specific conversion is handled the first time a given agent is started. When this happens, an extra message is included in the agent start output: Here is an example:

# itmcmd agent start ux
Processing. Please wait...
itmCANDLEDATA.sh: Component ux successfully converted to use data directory "/var/IBM/ITM".
Starting Monitoring Agent for UNIX OS ...
Monitoring Agent for UNIX OS started 

 






Converting an existing installation or new agents to use CANDLEDATA 

For existing installations, ITM provides a utility to convert a CANDLEHOME to use CANDLEDATA. You can also use this utility to convert a newly installed agent before it is started. Under the covers, the installer runs this same utility. 

itmCANDLEDATA.sh
[-b yes|no] 
[-h CANDLEHOME] 
[-l CANDLEDATA] 
[-f no|yes] 
[-p PC|*]
[-r no|yes] 

Where: 

 * 
 * -b
 * 
 * yes
 * 
 * CANDLEDATA
 * 
 * CANDLEHOME
 * 
 * CANDLEHOME
 * 
 * no
 * 
 * CANDLEDATA
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * -h
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * -l
 * 
 * CANDLEHOME
 * 
 * CANDLEDATA
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * -f
 * 
 * no
 * 
 * yes
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * -p
 * 
 * *
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * -r
 * 
 * no
 * 
 * yes
 * 


If you set the CANDLEHOME or CANDLEDATA environment variables before launching the installer, then those values are used as though they had been passed with the command options. If both the command option is used and the environment variable is defined before the conversion utility is started, the command option takes precedence. 

Example 1: Conversion of a typical CANDLEHOME can be performed with an incantation similar to this:  * 
 * itmCANDLEDATA.sh -l /var/IBM/ITM -b yes -p "*" -r yes


Example 2: Conversion of a newly installed agent to a CANDLEHOME where CANDLEDATA is already implemented can be performed with an incantation similar to this:  * 
 * itmCANDLEDATA.sh -b no -p "ux" -r yes







Using CANDLEDATA with Remote Deploy

You can define the location for local data remotely:

tacmd createnode (new installations):


 * 
 * CANDLEDATA
 * 
 * CANDLEDATA
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * tacmd createnode ... -o ENV_CANDLEDATA=
 * data_directory
 * ...
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * install.sh
 * 
 * CANDLEDATA
 * 
 * 

tacmd executecommand + itmCANDLEDATA.sh (existing installations): 
 * 
 * CANDLEDATA
 * 
 * tacmd updateagent
 * 
 * CANDLEDATA
 * 
 * tacmd executecommand
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * tacmd executecommand ... -c "/opt/IBM/ITM/bin/itmCANDLEDATA.sh -l /var/IBM/ITM -p \"*\" -b yes -r yes > /tmp/itmCANDLEDATA_remote.log 2>&1 &"
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *  Launches the conversion utility on the agent (/opt/IBM/ITM/bin/itmCANDLEDATA.sh). Specifies the local data directory (-l /var/IBM/ITM). Specifies all agents are to be converted (-p \"*\"). Note that the quotes are escaped because the entire command string is quoted. Specifies the CANDLEDATA directory is to be built (-b yes). Specifies the agents are to be restarted (-r yes). Redirects STDOUT and STDERR to a log file (> /tmp/itmCANDLEDATA_remote.log 2>&1). Note that the standard -o/-e/-d/-v options for tacmd executecommand don't function properly because of the agent restart. Note also that /tmp is used instead of /opt/IBM/ITM/logs; the latter is moved during the conversion process and therefore must be inactive. Launches the command in the background (trailing &). tacmd executecommand waits for the commands to complete, and this is signaled by a communication from the agent. However, since the agent is restarted by the command, it will never reply to tacmd executecommand. Running the command in the background allows tacmd executecommand to complete normally. 






Other Implications 

The following general ITM utilities have been updated to run properly when CANDLEDATA is implemented: 

 * cinfo - The output heading indicates the location of CANDLEDATA if it implemented. 
 * itmcmd agent start - Agent configurations are automatically updated if CANDLEDATA is implemented. Also, the portal server is prevented from starting if CANDLEDATA is implemented. 
 * itmcmd server start - The monitoring server is prevented from starting if CANDLEDATA is implemented. 
 * secureMain - Permissions and ownership in CANDLEDATA are maintained just as in CANDLEHOME. If secureMain was run before CANDLEDATA is implemented, the conversion utility automatically runs secureMain again as part of the conversion process. However, if you run the conversion utility as a nonroot user (not recommended), you must run secureMain manually after conversion is complete. 
 * tacmd pdcollect and pdcollect - Data is gathered from CANDLEDATA just as from CANDLEHOME. 
 * uninstall.sh - Relevant data is removed from in CANDLEDATA just as from CANDLEHOME. For uninstall.sh REMOVE EVERYTHING, both the CANDLEHOME and CANDLEDATA directories are removed.

 IBM Configuring access for HTTP and HTTPS in Jazz for Service Management - United States jazzsm11relnotes; jazzsm1101relnotes; jazzsm1102; jazzsm1103relnotes; relnotes; jazzsm1110relnotes; jazzsm1120relnotes; jazzsm1121relnotes; HTTP; HTTPS TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 By default, the Jazz™ for Service Management application server requires HTTPS access. You can set up the environment for both HTTP and HTTPS, however HTTP access is not supported. 

CAUSE
For security reasons, HTTP access is disabled by default and is not supported. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Before you begin


After installing Dashboard Application Services Hub and before beginning this procedure, log in to the console to ensure that it has connectivity and can start successfully. 

About this task 

Configuring for HTTP and HTTPS console access involves editing theweb.xmlfile of Web components. Use this procedure to identify and edit the appropriate Web XML files. 

Important: These steps are provided for information purposes only, as setting up the environment for HTTP access is not supported. 

Procedure 

1. Change to the following directory:JazzSM_WAS_Profile/config/cells/JazzSMNode01Cell/applications. 

2. From this location, locate theweb.xmlfiles in the following directories: 

 * For the Integrated Solutions Console web application archive:isc.ear/deployments/isc/isclite.war/WEB-INF 
 * For the Charts web application archive:isc.ear/deployments/isc/TIPChartPortlet.war/WEB-INF 
 * For the Dashboard Application Services Hub Change Password web application archive:isc.ear/deployments/isc/TIPChangePasswd.war/WEB-INF


3. Open one of the web.xmlfiles using a text editor. 4. Find the<transport-guarantee>element. The initial value of all<transport-guarantee>elements isCONFIDENTIAL, meaning that secure access is always required. 

5. Change the setting toNONEto enable both HTTP and HTTPS requests. The element now reads:<transport-guarantee>NONE</transport-guarantee>. 

6. Save the file, and then repeat these steps for the otherweb.xmldeployment files. 

7. Stop and restart the server. [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEKCU_1.1.2.1/com.ibm.psc.doc/admin/psc_ctr_admin_restart_jazzsm_servers.html] 

Example 

The following example is a section of theweb.xmlfile forTIPChangePasswdwhere the transport-guarantee parameter is set toNONE:
<security-constraint>
<display-name>
ChangePasswdControllerServletConstraint</display-name>
<web-resource-collection>
<web-resource-name>ChangePasswdControllerServlet</web-resource-name>
<url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
</web-resource-collection>
<auth-constraint>
<description>Roles</description>
<role-name>administrator</role-name>
<role-name>operator</role-name>
<role-name>configurator</role-name>
<role-name>monitor</role-name>
<role-name>iscadmins</role-name>
</auth-constraint>
<user-data-constraint>
<transport-guarantee>NONE</transport-guarantee>
</user-data-constraint>
</security-constraint> 

What to do next 

Users must now specify a different port, depending on the mode of access. The default port numbers are as follows:
http://<host_name>:16310/ibm/console
Use the HTTP port for logging in to the Dashboard Application Services Hub on the HTTP port .
https://<host_name>:16311/ibm/console
Use the HTTPS secure port for logging in to the Dashboard Application Services Hub. 

Note:If you want to use single sign-on (SSO) then you must use the fully qualified domain name of the Dashboard Application Services Hub host.

 IBM Using -Xgc:preferredHeapBase with -Xcompressedrefs - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 "Why does the JVM report a native out-of-memory (NOOM) when using compressed references? I am using a 64bit JVM and I clearly have plenty of memory left. How can I resolve this problem?" 

CAUSE
 

*In this note, please refer to Java Versioning: Java Version.Release.ServiceRelease.FixPack 
ex: Java 7.1.4.6 is the same as Java 7.1 SR4 FP6 is the same as Java 7 R1 SR4 FP6. 
The IBM JVM will automatically use compressed references [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/understanding/mm_compressed_references.html]when using a maximum heap size less than 25GB. This automated behavior was introduced in Java 6.1.5.0 and Java 7.0.4.0*. Compressed references (CR) decreases the size of Java objects making better use of available memory space. This better use of space results in improved JVM performance. *(Java 7.0.1.1 and later uses compressed references by default on z/OS) 

See Introducing WebSphere Compressed Reference Technology [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/webserver/appserv/was/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf] for detailed information on how Compressed References work. 

"When using compressed references, the size of the field used in the Java object for the Class Pointer and the Monitor/Lock is 32 bits instead of the 64bits that would be available in non-compressed mode. Because we are using 32 bits to store the location of these, and they are located in native (non-Java heap) memory, they must be allocated in the first 4GB of the address space - the maximum range we can address with the 32 bits." ~IBM Java Development Team 

If the Java heap itself is small (-Xmx), the JVM may allocate it in the lower 4GB of address space along with the Class Pointers and Monitors/Locks. If these Class Pointers, Monitors/Locks and Java heap (if included) cannot fit in the lower 4GB, a native out of memory (NOOM) [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-nativememory-linux/] will be thrown. 
ANSWER
Why Use Compressed References? 

Below the 4GB mark, the JVM does not have to perform any compression/decompression of the address pointer at runtime. Therefore, the best performance will be attained if the Class Pointers, Monitors/Locks and Java heap can all be contained comfortably within the lowest 4GB of the address space. 

 

Determining Address Location of Java Heap Memory 

To verify if the Java heap has memory regions below the 4GB mark, check the "Object Memory" section in the javacore:

Convert the "start" address from the hex value to a GB value [http://ss64.com/convert.html]. In the example below, 0x000000000F010000=0.23GB which is below the the 4GB (0x0000000100000000) mark.



 * [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890&amp;aid=1]


Setting the Preferred Heap Base with -Xgc:preferredHeapBase 

Starting with Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0, and later, the JVM will determine if the Java heap will fit comfortably in the lower 4GB. If it is too large, the JVM will automatically allocate the Java heap above the 4GB mark (APAR IV37797 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV37797]). 



NOTE: In IBM System z platforms (i.e. z/OS and z/Linux), automatic shift of the heap above the 4GB address space does NOT occur because on these platforms, there is an additional performance penalty 
associated with higher shift values. To resolve Native OOM issues due to a shortage of heap memory in the lower region on z platforms, use -Xnocompressedrefs (see below). 
See related: IBM Knowledge Center - JVMJ9GC089W [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_7.0.0/com.ibm.java.messages/diag/appendixes/messages/j9gc/message_jvmj9gc089.html] However, in earlier Java 6.1 and Java 7.0 versions (earlier than Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0), if the Java heap can not fit in the lower 4GB, a NOOM will occur. To avoid this problem, the generic JVM argument [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21417365] -Xgc:preferredHeapBase=<address> [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/understanding/mm_compressed_references.html] can be used to ensure the Java heap is allocated above the 4GB address space. This will leave more room for the Class Pointer and Monitor/Lock memory. 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * This will locate the Java heap starting at the 4GB mark thus leaving the lower 4GB for the other processes.


Increase Maximum Heap Size to Force Heap Allocation Above the 4GB mark 

Another way to ensure that the heap is allocated above the 4GB mark (Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0 and later) is to set a maximum heap size equal to or greater than 4GB. For example -Xmx4G will ensure that the heap will have to be allocated above the 4GB mark. This will not work in earlier versions of the JVM since these earlier versions allowed the heap to straddle the 4GB mark, placing part of the memory above and some below (fixed as part of APAR IV37797) . 

 

Further Investigation 

If after setting -Xgc:preferredHeapBase=<address> or -Xmx4G a NOOM is still encountered (Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0 and later), then further investigation is required at the application level. Look to decrease the size and usage of the applications Class Pointers and Monitors/Locks. Additionally, there are some WebSphere Application Server troubleshooting methods that may help reduce the native memory footprint. See: IBM Troubleshooting native memory issues [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg21373312].

Reserving Low-Memory Space with -Xmcrs

If there is still free memory in the system when a Native OutOfMemory (NOOM) occurs, then the problem may be a shortage of memory in the low-memory region (under 4GB). Even if the Java heap is located above this boundary, other data associated with Java objects can be located in the low-memory region.

The OS memory allocator will deal out low-memory freely, thus memory resources in the lower boundary may run out. Later when the JVM tries to allocate memory for an artifact which is required to be allocated in low-memory (because the JVM has only reserved a 32bit pointer for it) it fails and throws an OutOfMemoryError.

Starting in Java 6.0.16.3, Java 6.1.8.3, Java 7.0.8.10, Java 7.1.2.10, there is a parameter -Xmcrs [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_6.0.0/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/appendixes/cmdline/xmcrs.html] which allows the JVM to increase the amount of low memory it reserves on startup. With this setting, as long as the low-memory usage by the JVM does not exceed the -Xmcrs value, NOOM in the lower boundary will be avoided.

To set this parameter, first decide what a reasonable value for your lower memory requirements may be. Reasonable value is unique to each environment so there is not a general recommendation.


 * -Xmcrs<reasonable_value_for_lower_memory>

 * 
 * 
 * [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890&amp;aid=2]
 * 


Disabling Compressed References with -Xnocompressedrefs As a last resort, if the native memory still can not be contained under the 4GB mark, you can set -Xnocompressedrefs [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/appendixes/cmdline/Xnocompressedrefs.html] as a generic JVM argument. [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21417365] Using -Xnocompressedrefs will remove the use of compressed references and therefore remove the lower 4GB memory restriction on the Class Pointers and Monitors/Locks. This will however, result in a significant increase in Java heap memory requirements. It is not uncommon for 70% more heap space to be required. Due to the increased memory requirements it is strongly advised that the Java heap size is adjusted to a larger value and garbage collection is monitored and retuned as required.

Additionally, some benchmarks show a 10-20% relative throughput decrease when disabling compressed references: "Analysis shows that a 64-bit application without CR yields only 80-85% of 32-bit throughput but with CR yields 90-95%. Depending on application requirements, CR can improve performance up to 20% over standard 64-bit." See:ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/webserver/appserv/was/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/webserver/appserv/was/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf].

Before using -Xnocompressedrefs as a solution, first rule out the possibility of a native memory leak. Since using -Xnocompressedrefs will allow the the native memory to grow unbounded, a leak in native memory will lead to process size growth eventually leading to a process that needs to be paged out. The paging will incur performance overhead which will eventually lead to an unstable environment. Therefore careful consideration must be used when selecting -Xnocompressedrefs as a solution.


Memory Map Considerations 

The below figure is a generalization of how the JVM handles addresses in each section of the memory map based on heap size and compressed references (CR). Please note that at each stage beyond having all of the Java memory contained below the 4GB mark, there will be performance consequences: 



[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890&amp;aid=3] 

No Compressed References Overhead using -Xnocompressedrefs 
or
-Xmx > 25GB -increased memory footprint
-fewer/larger objects stored on heap leads to more frequent GC
-lower cache and translation look aside buffer (TLB) utilization [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890&amp;aid=4] Compressed References Overhead maximum heap address used by the Java JVM process is below 4GB none maximum heap address used by the Java JVM process is above 4GB but below 32GB compression/decompression of address pointers 


Getting Assistance From IBM Support 
If further assistance will be required from IBM WebSphere Support, please set the following -Xdump [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/tools/dumpagents_syntax.html] parameters in the generic JVM arguments [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21417365]: 
 * 
 * 
 * 


Then restart the JVM and recreate the problem. Once the NOOM is encountered, process the resulting system core with jextract [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21577379]. Send the jextracted core file, heapdump, javacore, snap trace, systemOut.log, native_stderr.log, native_stdout.log and systemErr.log to IBM Support [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21153852] for further analysis.

 IBM Automated data collection capability provided by wpcollector tool - United States wpcollector isalite isa lite data collection collector diagnostics TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What are the benefits of the wpcollector tool? How do I use this tool? 

ANSWER
Wpcollector is a command line tool that automates the collection of portal logs and configuration files. Using automated log collection early in the Case life cycle can greatly reduce the number of doc requests that are made by Support. 

Wpcollector is delivered with WebSphere Portal beginning with the 7.0 release. If tracing is required for the problem scenario, you must manually enable traceStrings and recreate the problem PRIOR to running wpcollector. 

To run wpcollector, please follow the steps, below:



 * If IBM Support has requested tracing, enable it as instructed by the L2 Support Engineer and then recreate the problem. If no tracing is requested, proceed to the step, below: 
   


 * If using Microsoft Windows, Unix/Linux, or IBM i, run the following script from the <wp_profile_root> [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHRKX_8.5.0/mp/reference/wpsdirstr.dita]/PortalServer/bin/ directory to begin the collection:  * 
    * 
    *  Unix/Linux: wpcollector.sh 
    *  i: wpcollector.sh 
    *  
    * Tip: To specify the option for collecting files for the Deployment Manager profile, use the "dmgr.root" parameter. For example: 
    *  wpcollector.bat -Ddmgr.root=/opt/IBM/WebSphere/profiles/dmgr_profile
   
   
 * If using IBM z/OS, proceed as follows [../reference/wpsdirstr.html%5C]:  * 
    * 
    *  In the Portal configuration panel, select Collect Diagnostics. 
    *  Follow the Customization Dialog instructions for submitting the Collect Diagnostics job (EJPSLOGS). 
    *  
    * Tip: To collect data from the Deployment Manager, the only requirement is to submit the job from the system where the Deployment Manager is installed (i.e. so it can access the files). There is no prompt in the ISPF panel for this.
   
   
 * Locate the wp.mustgather-<timestamp>.zip file in the <wp_profile_root> [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHRKX_8.5.0/mp/reference/wpsdirstr.dita]/filesForAutoPD/ directory and follow the instructions in "Exchanging information with IBM Technical Support for problem determination" [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21153852] to manually FTP the collection to IBM. If using z/OS, there may be additional z/OS-specific files required, such as WebSphere Portal servant region or controller region joblogs. Wpcollector currently does not collect these files. Your L2 Support Engineer will inform you in the event these files are needed and provide instructions for collecting them. 
   


 * If tracing was requested and enabled, please follow the instructions provided by the L2 Support Engineer to disable tracing from the environment

 IBM Minimum authorization required for SAP agent logon userid - United States authorization minimum IBMMON_AGENT profile settings agent userid SAP MySAP /IBMMON/AUTH TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What are the minimum authorizations required for the userid used by the ITM MySAP agent to logon a SAP system? 

ANSWER
By default, the MySAP agent uses the userid IBMMON_AGENT, that is created when ITM transport are imported in the SAP system, together with /IBMMON/AUTH role and profile.
If you don't want to use the default userid and profile, you need to create your own userid and provide it with a set of minimum required authorization settings.
Depending on the transport level, the required authorization may vary, but you can always refer to the values specified for the /IBMMON/AUTH profile available in the transport.
By looking at this profile, you can obtain the needed authorization information.
In example, for MySAP agent 6.2 IF16, those are the authorization defined for the /IBMMON/AUTH profile: 


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21657458&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21657458&aid=1]

You need to define your own userid providing the same set of authorization showed for the /IBMMON/AUTH profile to have mySAP agent performing successful data collection even using a non-default userid.

Applying the fix pack 
After you install the fix pack, you might have to do additional steps to apply the fix pack in your environment. To complete the update, see When and how to apply a modification or fix pack [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21665766]. 

Warning: 
If you have installed interim fixes for Operational Decision Manager V8.5.1, you must uninstall the fixes before you can install this fix pack. You must also stop the Operational Decision Manager sample server for this installation. If you do not uninstall the fixes and stop the server, the installation of the fix pack fails. If you attempt to install the fix pack without uninstalling the interim fixes, the installer uninstalls the interim fixes before the installer fails. In this case, stop the sample server and restart the installation. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

This fix pack adds support for a Windows x86-64 bit (WIX64) and PowerPC 
little-endian Log File agent. In addition, it resolves the APARs and 
defects listed in the "Problems Fixed" section below and includes the
superseded fixes listed in section 2.4.


2.0 Problems fixed
============
The following problems are addressed by this fix.

2.1 APARs
-------------

APAR: IV96363
Abstract: AGENT CRASHES ON WINDOWS 2016 WHILE READING LOG
Additional information: The agent crashes when a second file close
attempt follows a successful close of the monitored log.
Any subsequent I/O operations, such as fseek, fgets, fclose,
etc, either on that thread or another thread using the same
file handle may result in a failure or a crash because the
file is no longer open or the handle is invalid. The failure
sometimes results in an fgetpos failure with "errno 9 'Bad
file descriptor'" and returns with a -1.

This has been seen more prevalently on Windows 2016 but 
might occur on other platforms. This is related to IV60331.

On the agent system, with a minimum of the following trace:
"ERROR (UNIT:kumpfile ALL) (UNIT:kum0fdp0 ALL)" enabled, the
agent RAS1 log
<hostname>_lo_[instance]_kloagent_<timestamp>-<nn>.log
shows trace points similar to the following: 
- - -

APAR: IV95005
Abstract: "DETECTED CODEPAGE CP943, USING CP932 INSTEAD TO MAP 
BACKSLASH TO U+005C, NOT U+00A5 (YEN SYMBOL)" LOGGED ON
EVERY READ
Additional information: With a locale of Ja_JP (Shift-JIS) and
ERROR level trace, when the data is in the local code page,
the following message appears in agent RAS1 log for each
monitored event processed: 
"Detected codepage CP943, using CP932 instead to map
backslash to U+005C, no U+00A5 (Yen symbol)". 

This occurs on the agent system, with only ERROR trace
enabled. The agent RAS1 log 
<hostname>_lo_[instance]_kloagent_<timestamp>-<nn>.log 
contains trace points similar to the following:
- - - 
... 
kum0nget.c,438,"TranslateStringToUTF8") Detected codepage

APAR: IV93401
Abstract: USING REGEXLOGSOURCES TO MONITOR A REMOTE FILE FAILS
WITH FILE NOT FOUND 
Additional information: Using RegexLogSources to monitor a remote
file fails with "*** Unable to obtain statistics for file 
</LFA_test_logs/test_1.log> errno 2 'No such file or
directory". This occurs right after the file has been found
and matched. (Note: if the monitored file is also found
locally, it will succeed and monitor the local file.) 
Using the same file in LogSources results in a match. 

On the agent system, with a minimum of the following trace:
"ERROR (UNIT:kumpdcm2 ALL) (UNIT:kum0dir ALL)" enabled, the
agent RAS1 log 
<hostname>_lo_[instance]_kloagent_<timestamp>-<nn>.log shows 
trace points similar to the following:

APAR: IV89574
Abstract: INVALID CHARACTERS SEEN IN THE TRACE "*****Error: 
u_strFromUTF8 failed for string ... - <filename> .........,
status 10 <U_INVALID_CHAR_FOUND>" 
Additional information: In the agent RAS1 log, the trace points 
"*****Error: u_strFromUTF8 failed for string ..... - 
<filename> ..., status 10 <U_INVALID_CHAR_FOUND>" and 
"*****Error: uregex_setText failed..." contain garbled or 
invalid characters. The garbled characters are not in the
events themselves. 

Since these messages might occur when the agent is processing
a directory listing in order to determine the current file
to monitor as a result of a wildcard character in the 
RegexLogSources parameter, if the <filename> that results 
in this error is a file that should be monitored, then events
would be lost as the file is not monitored. The <filename> 
is in the directory for RegexLogSources. The additional 
invalid characters are not seen in the file listing on the
system. 

This was discovered on Log File Agent V6.3 and later on 
Windows, but also occurs on UNIX. 

On the agent system, with a minimum of the following 
trace enabled: "ERROR (UNIT:kum0regx ALL)", the agent RAS1
log <hostname>_lo_[instance]_kloagent_<timestamp>-<nn>.log
shows trace points similar to the following with some extra
characters added ".lnk":

APAR: IV79204
Abstract: LOGS RE-READ FROM THE BEGINNING WHEN DAYLIGHT SAVING
TIME (DST) ENDS
Additional information: On Windows systems, when daylight saving
time ends, log files might be re-read from the beginning
resulting in old events being re-sent. This only occurs 
when time is set back. 

The agent falsely detects that the configuration (.conf) 
and format (.fmt) file have changed when the system is
configured to "Automatically adjust clock for Daylight 
Saving time" and the file timestamps automatically change 
triggering an agent reset. When NumEventsToCatchUp is set
to -1, this series of events causes the log file to be
re-read from the beginning. This was seen with IF0003 and
IF0004 when monitoring log files on Windows operating 
systems, but not with the Windows Event log. This problem
did not occur on UNIX systems. 

To resolve this issue you must install and use the Windows
WIX64 (x86-64 bit) agent or specify NumEventsToCatchUp=-2
in the configuration file as a work-around. 

APAR: IV77403
Abstract: WINDOWS EVENT LOG EVENTS ARRIVED DELAYED WHEN 
NUMEVENTSTOCATCHUP IS USED 
Additional information: With a large input load (for example,
8004 events on each of 4 threads), Windows Event Log events
arrive with a significant delay when NumEventsToCatchUp=-1
is set in the conf file. The delay increases as the event
backlog grows. It can be in the order of 5 minutes depending
on CPU, etc. This is a result of the inherent overhead in
maintaing the position (bookmark) in the Windows Event Log
when NumEventsToCatchUp is set to -1 or n. 

This is a follow-on to APAR IV63704. 

APAR: IV76731
Abstract: UNABLE TO RENAME FILE WHICH IS BEING MONITORED BY ITM
LOG FILE AGENT 
Additional information: On Windows systems, when the agent is
monitoring an application log, the log file cannot be 
renamed because the file is open or in use. When new
records are added to the log, the agent opens the log, 
reads the log and closes the log. However, when a large
volume of events are written to the log file, the log file
may remain open or in use due to operating system
efficiencies. As a result, an attempt to rename the log 
file may fail. This problem occurs more prevently with the
WINNT 32-bit agent, when NumEventsToCatchUp is set to -1.

To minimize occurrence of this issue, use the Windows (WIX64) 
x86-64 bit Log File agent. 

APAR: IV60331
Abstract: RESETTING OF MULTIPLE CONF/FORMAT FILES CAUSES A CRASH
Additional information: Updating multiple configuration (.conf) 
or format (.fmt) files, usually via a script or a situation 
that runs frequently, and causes the agent to reset might 
result in a core or crash. This also might be more likely 
to occur with multiple subnodes to monitor a large number
of files, for example, 100 files. The root cause of the
crash is closing a file which is already closed or no longer
exists. 

This has been seen, mainly on Linux, on agent start-up,
shutdown or reset as a result of configuration file changes. 
The problem was originally discovered in Log File Agent 
v6.2.3.1.

The <hostname>_lo_<#########>.log might contain information

APAR: IV82875
Abstract: WINEVENTLOG REREAD FROM BEGINNING ON AGENT RESTART 
Additional information: When monitoring Windows® Event Logs, the
event log is re-read from the beginning when the agent is
restarted, resulting in old events being sent. This occurs 
on Microsoft Windows 2003 or 2008 systems with the following
settings in the agent configuration file: 
- WINEVENTLOGS=<named event logs> 
- NumEventsToCatchUp=-2 
- UseNewEventLogAPI=n (must be set on Windows 2008 systems) 

Note: NumEventsToCatchUp=-2 is not supported for Windows
Event logs. 

Problem Determination: On the LO agent system, with a 
minimum of the following trace specification:
KBB_RAS1: ERROR (UNIT:WinLogQuery ALL) 
the agent RAS1 log 
<hostname>_lo_[instance]_kloagent_<timestamp>-<nn>.log shows 
trace points similar to the following: 
- - -

APAR: IV82170
Abstract: SOME EVENTS ARE NOT DETECTED WHEN BOTH MULTI-LINE AND
SINGLE-LINE FORMATS ARE USED 
Additional information: When using a format file which contains
both multi-line and single line formats, some events might
not be detected and are discarded. In this case, the events
which were discarded were single lines of data which matched
the single line formats. The single lines were discarded
because the number of lines remaining to be processed was
less than or equal to (not greater than) the maximum number
of lines in the multi-line format. 

This problem was discovered using errpt, but it can occur
with other pipes such as syslog, or with a monitored file. 
It occurs on Log File Agent V6.3, up to Interim Fix 0005 
and is platform independent.

Problem Determination: On the LO agent system, with a 
minimum of the following trace specification: 
KBB_RAS1: ERROR (UNIT:logmonitor ALL)(UNIT:kumrmfr ALL)(UNIT:kumpfile ALL) 
the agent RAS1 log 
<hostname>_lo_[instance]_kloagent_<timestamp>-<nn>.log shows 
all the lines are read into the buffer properly. Records
are processed until the ReadCount is equal to the 
AttributeSetCount, and then the next "File Data Record" is 
empty, even though more unprocessed data was still in the
buffer.

Abstract: PROCESS PRIORITY CLASS SETTINGS NOT REFLECTED OR SET
FOR LOG FILE AGENT PROCESS
Additional information: After configuring the Process Priority
class value, the agent process running on Red Hat Linux
does not set the corresponding priority or niceness value
for its process. The priority is set on the thread and not
the process (PID).

For example, after configuring the agent and setting the 
ProcessPriorityClass in the configuration file or during 
configuration to "D": 

When the ps command is issued, the priority of the agent
process remains same: 
# ps -eo priority,nice,comm,args,pid,time | grep kloagent

APAR: IV78340
Abstract: EVENT ARRIVAL DELAYED DUE TO CPU THROTTLING
Additional information: After a system reboot which includes
automatic start-up of a Log File Agent instance, events
become increasingly delayed from minutes to as much as hours.
The root cause of the delay is the CPU throttling, which
occurs even when the Process maximum CPU percentage is
configured at 100%, the default which indicates no CPU
throttling, because at that point internally the maximum CPU
is reset to zero. This can occur with only a light flow rate
of events. 

It was discovered on HP-UX and although, it is platform
independent, it may be more prevalent on HP-UX. 

Problem Determination: With a minimum of the following trace

APAR: IV76119
Abstract: REMOVAL OF RC4 CIPHER FROM REMOTE MONITORING
Additional information: The arcfour (RC4) cipher algorithm, as used
in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, could allow a remote
attacker to obtain sensitive information. Successful
exploitation could allow an attacker to retrieve sensitive
information. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as
"Bar Mitzvah Attack" (CVE-2015-2808). Support for the arcfour
cipher is being removed. 

APAR: IV75776
Abstract: UNABLE TO OBTAIN MONITORED FILE STATISTICS ERROR WHEN FILE
NAME CONTAINS DOUBLE-BYTE CHARACTERS 
Additional information: When monitoring a file which contains
Japanese or double-byte characters in the filename, the
message "Unable to obtain statistics for file < <filename> >
errno 2 'No such file or directory'" is written to the agent
log at approximately every poll interval cycle. However, the
file exists and is correctly monitored. 

This occurs on Log File Agent version 6.3.0 and is platform
independent.

Problem Determination: With a minimum of the following trace
enabled: "KBB_RAS1=ERROR (UNIT:kum0dir ALL)", the agent RAS1
log <hostname>_lo_[instance]_kloagent_<timestamp>-<nn>.log
contains trace points similar to the following:

APAR: IV75603
Abstract: BACKSLASH \ INCORRECTLY TRANSLATED ON WINDOWS WHEN SENT
TO EIF
Additional information: On Windows systems when the event is
translated back from UTF-8 to the native code page shift-JIS
(SJIS/943), in order to send the event to Event Integration
Facility (EIF), the backslash character is incorrectly
translated. The backslash character (0x5c) is translated to
UTF-8 0xC2A5, and when it is translated back to the native
code page, it is incorrectly translated to 0x1A which may
show as a blank space or unprintable character. As a result
of IV68698, code page 932 is used to translate the event to
UTF-8, however code page 943 is still being used to translate
the event from UTF-8 back to the native code page Shift-JIS.

Example: 
Log File Agent v6.3 GA <cache file> 
70203_Base;msg='Tivoli [message]\[message]' 

Log File Agent v6.3 and 6.3.0-TIV-ITM_LFA-IF0004

APAR: IV75336
Abstract: LFA ASSOCIATED WITH LOG ANALYSIS IS DROPPING EVENTS
Additional information: The agent when associated with Log
Analysis is dropping events. When sending large amounts of
events to Event Integration Facility (EIF), the agent is
unable to keep up. The message "WARNING: <1000> events
already on queue, dropping the oldest one", where <1000>
is the default MaxEventQueueDepth value, is seen in the 
agent RAS1 log.

Abstract: ABLE TO MONITOR FILES GREATER THAN 2GB ON 32-BIT
LINUX
Additional information: When attempting to monitor files greater
than 2 gigabytes on a 32-bit Linux operating system, the
file is not monitored and is not displayed in the Monitored
File Workspace in the portal. A trace in the log shows
"File too large". 

Problem Determination: With a minimum of the following trace
enabled: "KBB_RAS1: ERROR (UNIT:kum0fdp0 ALL) (UNIT:kumpstdio
ALL)", the agent RAS1 log 
<hostname>_lo_[instance]_kloagent_<timestamp>-<nn>.log 
contains trace points similar to the following: 
- - -

APAR: IV74480
Abstract: COMPAREBYLASTUPDATE DOES NOT MONITOR THE MOST RECENT
REMOTE FILE ACROSS MULTIPLE DIRECTORIES 
Additional information: When monitoring a remote log file using
regular expression meta characters (wildcard) in one directory
pattern of the path, and using the FileComparisonMode of
"CompareByLastUpdate", the most recent file from the most 
recent directory is not monitored. Only the most recent 
file in the first directory returned which matches the
pattern, is monitored. 

CompareByLastUpdate should monitor the file with the most 
recent last update timestamp across all the directories. 

This occurs on Log File Agent version 6.3.0 and appears to
be platform independent. It does not occur for local files. 

Problem Determination: With a minimum of the following trace
enabled: "KBB_RAS1: ERROR (UNIT:kum0sshlib ALL) (UNIT:kumpdcm ALL)", 
the agent RAS1 log 
<hostname>_lo_[instance]_kloagent_<timestamp>-<nn>.log

APAR: IV72073 
Abstract: PATH TO MONITORED FILE NAME STARTS WITH DOUBLE SLASHES (//)
Additional information: Using the RegexLogSources option to
monitor a file which contains a regular expression meta 
character in the first directory of the path, the resulting
monitored file name path starts with 2 forward slashes (//). 
For example: RegexLogSources=/LFA_.*/ts_.*\.log , the File
Name field contains "//LFA_test/ts_01.log". 

The extra starting slash is a cosmetic issue only and does
not cause any issues. The file is properly monitored. 
The extra forward slash at the beginning of the path can
be seen on the portal in the File Name field in the Monitored
File Status on the Data Collection workspace or in the agent
logs. 

The problem exists on Log File Agent v6.3.0 and v6.2.3.2. 
This problem is platform independent. 
However on Windows systems, if you specify the drive letter 
preceding the path in the RegexLogSources option, the problem 
does not occur. 

Problem Determination: 
On the the portal in the File Name field of the Data Collection 
workspace, the File Name field contains, for example, 
//LFA_test_logs/ts_01.log 

With a minimum of the following trace enabled: 
"KBB_RAS1: ERROR (UNIT:kumpdcm ALL)", the agent RAS1 log 
<hostname>_lo_[instance]_kloagent_<timestamp>-<nn>.log

Abstract: %NNNN SYSTEM PARAMETERS NOT RESOLVED IN WINDOWS EVENT
LOG EVENTS 
Additional information: On Windows 2003, the Log File Agent does
not resolve %nnnn system parameters in Windows Event Log
events. Windows Event Viewer is able to resolve the %nnnn to
the correct message. This problem might also be seen on
Windows 2008, when "UseNewEventLogAPI=N" is set in the agent
configuration file. 

For example, the event is seen as:

------------------------ 
APAR: IV68698
Abstract: WITH JAPANESE LOCALE, BACKSLASH CHARACTER IS WRONGLY
TRANSLATED WHEN INCLUDED IN TAKE ACTION COMMAND STRING
Additional information: When an event which is detected by the agent
is output from a situation using a Take Action command, by a 
redirection, etc.; a single-byte backslash character ("\") is
displayed as a double-byte "middle point" character. 

The character is correctly displayed in the portal indicating 
that it is correctly read and translated by the agent when
read from the monitored log file. 

The problem only occurs when the attribute containing 
backslash is used in a Take Action command. When the
character is read from the monitored file, it is converted 
from ibm-943_P15A-2003 to UTF-8 0xC2A5 - the UTF8
representation of backslash\yen). When the take action is 
performed either at the agent or the monitoring server, the
agent translates the 0xC2A5 from UTF-8 to the native CP932
which results in the 0xFCFC character code. 

The problem exists on the Log File Agent version 6.3.0
Interim Fix 0003 (6.3.0-TIV-ITM_LFA-IF0003) and earlier, with
Japanese locale. It can occur on Windows and UNIX® platforms.

Abstract: ALL EVENTS ARE NOT DETECTED AND SENT AS EXPECTED WHEN 
TRANSLATING FROM A MULTI-BYTE CODE PAGE 
Additional information: All events are not matched and sent to the 
event receiver. The events that are received might contain
garbled characters. Close examination of the agent log with
tracing enabled, shows that parts of the events or lines are
overwritten. 

This only occurs when translating the data from a multi-byte 
code page to UTF-8 and the conversion fails. The conversion 
fails because the agent was unable to read all the bytes 
required for a complete character into its buffer. This might 
occur if a group of messages are sent or when a message 
exceeds the maximum event size (EventMaxSize). Increasing the
EventMaxSize might produce different results. 

The problem exists on the following Log File Agent versions: 
- 6.3.0 interim fix 0003 and earlier 
- 6.2.3.2 and later 
- 6.2.2.4 Interim Fix 07 and later. 
It is platform independent.

monitored log is re-read from the beginning, resulting in
duplicate events. 

This issue occurs on AIX, Linux. It does not exist on Windows

"NONE" 
Additional information: The event msg field or slot might contain 
a value of "None", when a Windows event log message contains
a %n where n is a number in the event description field. 
If the %n is not substituted, the Microsoft EvtFormatMessage
API returns ERROR_EVT_UNRESOLVED_VALUE_INSERT (15029) which
the agent treats as an error. As a result of the error, the 
agent discards the event description and substitutes "None".

Abstract: EXCEPTION ACCESS VIOLATION WHEN EVENT EXCEEDS MAXIMUM 
EVENT SIZE 
Additional information: The kloagent process may terminate with an 
Exception 0xC0000005 (ACCESS_VIOLATION), when the size of an
event exceeds the maximum event size (EventMaxSize) and is
truncated. The LO agent instance unexpectedly stops and goes
offline. 

The crash occurs when the truncation occurs on a boundary 
condition, and the event is truncated at a single quote and 
has no ending semi-colon. It only occurs in the mapping of 
the attribute slots to CustomSlots when sending events to IBM
Tivoli Monitoring from either a Windows event log or a file.

Abstract: HEAVY WINDOWS EVENT LOG LOAD CAUSES DELAYS AND THE
APPEARANCE OF HANGS 
Additional information: A heavy Windows event log throughput causes
delays in the events being displayed on the portal. 
For example: when sending 1000 events per second per thread,
on 4 threads, the delay in seeing the events on the portal
might be as much as 30 minutes. The delay increases as the
PollInterval increases. 

The agent might also appear to hang if too many duplicate
Windows Event log messages are received.

sending events forward, even though the events are not being
received by the EIF receiver.

Abstract: EVENTS FROM WINDOWS EVENT LOG ARE INTERMITTENTLY NOT
DETECTED.
Additional information: Windows Event Log events are
intermittently not detected and sent. With the UnmatchLog
parameter specified, the event is also not saved in the
UnmatchLog file. In previous occurrences, the missing event
matches one of the format expressions and is sent. With
tracing set as described below, after the initial rendering
of the Windows Event Log event is seen in the agent log,
there are no occurrences of the event in the log. 

This is more likely to occur when monitoring more than one
Windows Event Log (for example: Application, Security, 
System, etc). 

This problem occurs on Windows systems with Log File Agent 
version 6.2.3.2 and 6.3.

APAR: IV42745
Abstract: SOME LINES WRITTEN IN PIECES ARE UNMATCHED AND PARTIALLY
DISCARDED 
Additional information: When a single line is written to the
monitored file in separate pieces, sometimes the line does
not match and is not sent as an event. This is because the
latter or subsequent piece of the line is written to the same
location in the internal read buffer and overwrites the
initial piece of the line. The resulting partial line does
not match the formats and is sent to the UnmatchLog, if one
was specified in the configuration file. This might occur
intermittently when lines are written in multiple parts,
particularly on Windows systems. 

With a minimum of KBB_RAS1: ERROR (UNIT:kumprmfr ALL), the
agent log <hostname>_lo_<instance>_kloagent_<timestamp>.log
contains trace entries similar to the following: 
- - - 
... 
...:kumprmfr.c,1015,"KUMP_ReadMonitorFileUnicodeRecord")

The second part of line is written to the same location in
the buffer, in the above example 0x51A6A58, overwriting the
first part of the line. 

APAR: IV42699
Abstract: LAST MATCHING LINE OF LOG IS NOT IMMEDIATELY SENT AS A
MATCHING EVENT 
Additional information: With record patterns that span multiple
lines (RECORDSET patterns), the last matching line of a
monitored file is not immediately sent as an event and it
does not show up in the UnmatchLog, if one was specified.
The amount of wait time till the event is actually sent is a
factor of the PollInterval. 

With a minimum of KBB_RAS1: ERROR (UNIT:kumprmfr ALL)

Additional information: When an opening { bracket is used without a
closing bracket } in a FORMAT statement of the format file,
the agent log ends with a "Load Metafile Function - 
EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION" on agent start-up. 
The agent process is still running but it is waiting for 
initialization to complete successfully and is not monitoring. 
The Data collection status Error Code is "No ERROR" but there
is no entry in the Monitored File Status for the monitored

APAR: IV39967
Abstract: RESTORED FILE IS NOT MONITORED AFTER CONF/FMT FILES
MODIFIED
Additional information: A restored log file is no longer monitored
and no new events are processed, when the sequence of all the
following events occur: 
a) update the conf or fmt file to trigger reset processing, 
b) remove the file, for example via un-mount, rename, delete, 
move 
c) wait for the 'File does not exist' status 
d) restore the file. 
The Data Collection workspace continues to show a File Status 
of "FILE DOES NOT EXIST". 

If the reset process (step a) is not triggered and only the
file is removed, the file is re-discovered properly. If only
the reset process (step a) is triggered, it also continues to 
function properly. 
Note: When the file is re-discovered after it is restored, it 
is read from the beginning as a new file. This is not new 
behavior with this APAR. 

The root cause of this problem occurs on LFA v6.3, but the log 
file is monitored when the file is restored. 

APAR: IV37051
Abstract: EVENTS INTERMITTENTLY NOT MATCHED WHEN LINE WRITTEN IN
PIECES
Additional information: When an application writes only part of the
line and later writes the remainder of the line, the line
intermittently matches as an event with no changes to the fmt
file. This occurs more prevalently on Windows systems because
the operating system notifies the agent when the file has
changed. When the first part of the line is written, the agent
is notified but the partial line does not match any formats.
When the second part of the line is written, the agent is
notified again but the remainder of the line does not match
any formats. The two pieces of the line are treated as two
lines, neither of which match and both pieces are written as
two lines to the UnmatchLog, if one is configured. 

Defect: 207998
Abstract: Agent does not continue to retry on remote log, when 
RC -3, because errno is zero.
Additional information: When monitoring remote log files where the
connection breaks; for example, the remote system shuts down
or a network outage, the agent does not continually try
to re-establish the connection. The remote file is not
monitored. The Monitored File Status might not show a row
for the file.

With a minimum of "KBB_RAS1: ERROR tracing, the agent log

Abstract: Failed to load GSKit library
Additional information: When both GSKit version 7 and 8 are 
installed on the same agent machine, either because of two
IBM Tivoli Monitoring installs, or some other product that
put a GSKit into the system /usr/lib directory, the wrong
version of the library is loaded and the GSKit 
initialization fails. This problem has only been seen on
Linux®.

Defect: 205184

Defect: 204120
Abstract: Log agent crashes on Solaris due to mis-aligned integer
Additional information: Agent crashes in KUMP_DoDPdataToDCH when it
formats data from a buffer into integers and other formats,
due to a copy of an odd-aligned integer. 

Defect: 203012
Abstract: LogSources wildcards match directories remote log -31 err
Additional information: If a LogSources specifies a remote directory
and not a remote file, the Monitored File Status shows "File
Status" OK, "File Type" of "REGULAR FILE", "PIPE" or
"UNKNOWN" and "Current File Size" 4096, but no files are
monitored.

Note: After the fix, when there are no wildcards in the
directory path, it may still show Status" OK, "File Type"
of "REGULAR FILE".

4.0 Image directory contents
===================
This fix image contains the following files:

- 6.30-TIV-ITM_LFA-FP0002.tar.gz
- 6.30-TIV-ITM_LFA-FP0002.README

5.0 Installation instructions 
==================

5.1 Before installing the fix 
-------------------------------
- The prerequisites listed under section 3.1 entitled 'Prerequisites
for this fix' must be installed before this fix can be installed.

- For the purpose of this README, the symbol <CANDLEHOME> is the 
IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory. The default value
for CANDLEHOME is '/opt/IBM/ITM' on UNIX systems and 'C:\IBM\ITM'
on Windows systems.

- Before installing this fix on UNIX systems, set the environment 
variable CANDLEHOME to the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation
directory.

For example: 
> CANDLEHOME=/opt/IBM/ITM
> export CANDLEHOME 

- Because there is no uninstall utility for this fix, make sure to
perform a backup of your environment before installing this fix.

- NOTE: Before installing the LO x86-64 bit agent, you must
un-install the WINNT 32-bit version of the agent and the 32/64 
bit compatibility package.


5.2 Local agent update
--------------------------
For installation instructions, see the Log File Agent User's Guide
v6.3.0: 
http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSTFXA_6.3.0/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3/logfile/logfileagent_user.htm?lang=en [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSTFXA_6.3.0/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3/logfile/logfileagent_user.htm?lang=en]

Note: 
1. The PowerPC little-endian installation image is located in the
PPC_LE directory of the installation image. Invoke ./install.sh
from this directory.

2. On Windows systems, when the installation completes, the 
Readme.txt displays "Welcome to IBM Tivoli Monitoring V6.2.3 Fix
Pack 5." This is the installer level and Readme and is not an 
error.

5.3 Remote agent update
----------------------------
1. Transfer the archive file 6.3.0-TIV-ITM_LFA-FP0002.tar.gz to a
temporary directory on the IBM Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring 
Server system. For the purpose of this README, the symbol <TEMP>
represents the fully qualified path to this directory. Note: On
Windows systems, this path includes the drive letter.

2. Expand the archive file using the "tar" command on UNIX systems or
an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a directory
structure that contains fixes for all of the supported platforms.

3. To add the agent fix bundles into the remote deploy depot, use
the "tacmd addBundles" command found in $CANDLEHOME/bin on UNIX
systems or in %CANDLE_HOME%\bin on Windows systems. For more
information on the "tacmd addBundles" command, see the IBM Tivoli
Monitoring Administrator's Guide.

Note: 
1. The prerequisite Log File Agent bundles must also be in the
depot, to ensure successful completion of the remote agent update.
2. The 6.3.0-TIV-ITM_LFA-FP000<n> bundles must be removed from the
depot, using the "tacmd removeBundles" command. 
For example: tacmd removeBundles -t lo -v 06300000<n>

On UNIX systems, 
if the fix was expanded to <TEMP>/6.3.0-TIV-ITM_LFA-FP0002:
> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd addBundles -n 
-i <TEMP>/6.3.0-TIV-ITM_LFA-FP0002 

On Windows systems, 
if the fix was expanded to <TEMP>\6.3.0-TIV-ITM_LFA-FP0002:
> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd addBundles -n 
-i <TEMP>\6.3.0-TIV-ITM_LFA-FP0002 

where:
-n indicates that prerequisite bundles are not automatically
added. The -n parameter must be used because the fix 
directory does not contain any prerequisites that the fix
might require. Please see Section 3.1 for the prerequisites
for this fix.
-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to be
added to the depot. 

4. To log in to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring server, and deploy
the fix to the appropriate nodes where the agent is running, use
the following "tacmd" commands. For more information on the 
"tacmd login" and "tacmd updateAgent" commands, see the IBM Tivoli
Monitoring Administrator's Guide.

On UNIX systems: 
> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>
-u <itmuser> 
-p <password>

> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems

The output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the
remote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the
"tacmd updateAgent" command.

> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd updateAgent -t lo 
-n <Managed system name>
-v 06300200

On Windows systems:
> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd login -s <server>
-u <itmuser> 
-p <password>

> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd listSystems

The output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the
remote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the
"tacmd updateAgent" command.

> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd updateAgent -t LO 
-n <Managed system name> 
-v 06300200

Note:
- The component (-t) for the "tacmd updateAgent" command is
specified as two characters (LO), not three characters (KLO).
- The node (-n) for the "tacmd updateAgent" command is the managed
system name of the operating system (OS) agent to be updated.
The target node for the "tacmd updateAgent" command is always
an OS agent.

5.2 Agent support update
------------------------------
Fix pack 6.3.0-TIV-ITM_LFA-FP0001 included new certificates 
in the agent support files which need to be installed. If you have
already installed these updates, there are no additional installation 
steps. Otherwise, install the updates to the Tivoli Enterprise
Monitoring Server, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, or Tivoli
Enterprise Portal Desktop. For more information about installing 
application support, see Installing and enabling application support
in the IBM Tivoli Monitoring Installation and Setup Guide.

6.0 Additional installation information
========================

6.1 Installation instructions for agent baroc file
-----------------------------------------------------
There are no updates to the baroc files included in this fix or any
of the superseded fixes. No additional installation steps are
required.

6.2 Verifying the update
----------------------------
1. To verify the agent was updated correctly, use the "tacmd" command
to view the agent's current version after the agent is restarted.
You are required to log in to a Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring
Server prior to viewing the agent version. 

For example:
On UNIX systems, where $CANDLEHOME is the IBM Tivoli Monitoring
installation directory, the default location is '/opt/IBM/ITM'. 

> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>
-u <itmuser> 
-p <password>

> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems -t LO

On Windows systems, where %CANDLE_HOME% is the IBM Tivoli
Monitoring installation directory, the default location
is 'C:\IBM\ITM'. 

> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd login -s <server>
-u <itmuser> 
-p <password>

> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd listSystems -t LO 

Note: The component (-t) for the "tacmd listSystems" command is
specified as two characters (LO), not three characters (KLO).

When the agent update is successful, the agent version is: 
06.30.02.00.

After the agent is restarted, you can also use the GUI to verify
the agent was successfully updated.

For the agent on Windows systems, the version number is 
06.30.02.00. 

2. To verify the agent you are running contains the updates from the
fix, see the following lines in the agent log 
<hostname>_lo_<instance>_kloagent_<timestamp>.log located in
$CANDLEHOME/logs on UNIX systems and
%CANDLE_HOME%\tmaitm6\logs on Windows systems:

<timestamp> Component: ira
<timestamp> Driver: agent_fac_63:201709131450/4769716.3 
<timestamp> Timestamp: Sep 13 2017 ...

 IBM Rule Team Server/Decision Center is timing out while performing certain operations - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How to resolve "Transaction timed out after 601 seconds" error while performing certain operations in Rule Team Server (RTS)/Decision Center (DC)? 

SYMPTOM
While generating ruleapps in RTS/DC, the following error is thrown after a few minutes (typically 5 or 10 minutes): 

On WebLogic: 

Rule Team Server has encountered an unexpected error. The internal error message is: #{SelectionBean.asynchAction}: javax.faces.el.EvaluationException: java.lang.RuntimeException: java.sql.SQLException: The transaction is no longer active - status: 'Marked rollback. [Reason=weblogic.transaction.internal.TimedOutException: Transaction timed out after 601 seconds BEA1-5057DF8C316E1C1224CD]'. No further JDBC access is allowed within this transaction. 

... 

 

On WebSphere: 
TimeoutManage I WTRN0006W: Transaction XXX has timed out after 300 seconds.
TimeoutManage I WTRN0124I: When the timeout occurred the thread with which the transaction is, or was most recently, associated was Thread[WebContainer : 3,5,main]. The stack trace of this thread when the timeout occurred was: 
ilog.rules.brl.parsing.parser.earley.IlrEarleyParser.errorRecovery(IlrEarleyParser.java:1046)
ilog.rules.brl.parsing.parser.earley.IlrEarleyParser.buildCharts(IlrEarleyParser.java:772)
ilog.rules.brl.parsing.parser.earley.IlrEarleyParser.parse(IlrEarleyParser.java:511)
...


CAUSE
The transaction timeout for RTS/DC is set to 10 minutes by default in the teamserver web module deployment descriptor (WEB-INF/web.xml), and application servers also have container level transaction timeouts that are configurable. If a transactional operation performed by RTS/DC takes longer than these timeouts to complete, the transaction is rolled back and the operation is not completed.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If you perform time consuming operations in large repositories, you can increase the timeout value in the web.xml file of the RTS/DC EAR file (jrules-teamserver-<appserver>.ear\teamserver.war\WEB-INF) by changing the value of the property ilog.rules.teamserver.transaction.timeout. 


You will find the property in the file web.xml defined as below:
...
<context-param>
<description>Modify the timeout value that is associated with transactions (in seconds)</description>
<param-name>ilog.rules.teamserver.transaction.timeout</param-name>
<param-value>600</param-value>
</context-param> 
... 

Another place to look for are application server specific transaction timeout configurations. For example, for WebSphere Application Server, check the "Maximum transaction timeout" and increase it as needed as described here [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/info/ae/ae/tjta_settlog.html].

 IBM DataPower firmware version 6.0 will enable TLS v1.2 or v1.1 by default - United States ssl tsl client hello handshake fail failed version 6.0 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

THIS DOCUMENT APPLIES ONLY TO THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGE VERSION(S):
 English 

QUESTION
 Why would some outgoing SSL handshakes fail with firmware version 6.0 but not prior firmware versions? 

CAUSE
Beginning in firmware version 6.0 and above, the default SSL settings have changed. The Crypto profiles now have TLSv1.2 and 1.1 which will be enabled by default. This affects the protocol version included in the Client Hello when DataPower is acting as the SSL client. If TLSv1.2 is not supported, the server still negotiates to the most secure supported protocol (e.g. TLSv1.1, TLSv1.0, SSLv3) if enabled. 

Some legacy servers with non-compliant implementations of SSL may reject connection attempts when TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.1 are used. In these cases, the handshake fails without properly negotiating to a mutually agreeable protocol.

The TLS versions 1.1 and 1.2 are part of the requirements for being compliant with NIST SP800-131a.



ANSWER
Upgrade the SSL server to a version compliant with the SSL/TLS specifications. If required you may disable TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.1 within the Crypto Profile to allow compatibility. 


Within the domain simply navigate to the Objects> Crypto Configuration> Crypto Profile>
Then simply click on your specific profile to view the Options selection and see what SSL protocol versions are supported.

Any further questions or issues please feel free to contact DataPower support. A packet trace and error report would be the most helpful information in viewing the problem. 

 IBM Search option for a reserved word or character in documents in Atlas - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I search for a string which has reserved words or characters when searching in documents in Atlas? 

CAUSE
There are specific options to use in oracle when you search for certain strings

ANSWER
When there is a "-" in a string you are searching for, you need to use "\" in front of the "-" 

For example - "String1-String2" should be searched as "String1\-String2" 

Please refer to the oracle documentation for Special Characters in Oracle Text Queries 

 IBM Verify an IEM server upgrade is still in progress - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How can I tell if the IBM Endpoint Manager (BigFix) server database upgrade is progressing? 

CAUSE
When upgrading a BigFix server, most of the time is usually spent upgrading the database. The installer launches the BESAdmin utility to complete this part of the upgrade, but does not provide detailed progress during this phase. For some long running upgrades, it may appear that the upgrade is hung or not progressing: 

On Windows, the BESAdmin UI will indicate "Not Responding" if clicked on at this point. 

On Linux, the message "Info: Configuring the database for the server component, please wait ... " is reported.


ANSWER
It is important to allow the upgrade to complete when in this state, and not attempt to cancel or kill the upgrade process. To verify the upgrade is still active, check that the following process is still running: 

Windows: BESAdmin.exe 

Linux: BESAdmin 

CPU usage of BESAdmin may be minimal during times when the database is doing most of the work, so just the existence of the process is good confirmation. For additional confirmation, the BFEnterprise or BFENT database can be monitored for activity using SQL Server Profiler or the DB2 'CREATE EVENT MONITOR' statement to track SQL statement events.

 IBM An unexpected ruleset version is executed - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why is Rule Execution Server (RES) not executing the expected version of a ruleset ?
What are the possible causes after a hot deployment for Rule Execution Server not to use the updated ruleset ? 

CAUSE
Possible causes for unexpected versions to be executed are: 
- the RES client requesting execution may be passing a wrong ruleset path
- a hot deploy notification was not sent by the RES console, or not received by all the Execution Units (XU)
- the ruleset parsing policy may be delaying the use of a ruleset version until its parsing is complete
- the updated ruleset cannot be parsed successfully and RES falls back on an earlier active version that parses


ANSWER
First validate that the RES components (the Execution Unit, the Management Console and the Client Application bundling the RES client library, which may be HTDS, MTDS, the SSP or a custom application) have been installed properly as per the documentation, see Configuring Rule Execution Server [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.config/config_ds_res/tpc_res_config.html]. 

The ruleset version that is executed depends first on the ruleset path that is requested. Specifying a ruleset path with no version ( such as /MyRuleApp/MyRuleset/ ) is interpreted as a request to execute the highest version of the ruleset, as opposed to a version specific ruleset path ( such as /MyRuleApp/2.0/MyRuleset/1.0 ). Validate that the executed ruleset path is indeed unexpected considering the requested ruleset path. 

 

A common situation for an unexpected ruleset version to be executed is that of a hot deployment that is not successfully completed. The more frequent causes for the hot deployment not to happen as expected are: 

 * Permission issue: the user publishing the ruleset update must have sufficient administrative rights ( Monitor role in WebSphere Application Server ) in order for the deployment to notify all the Execution Units of the ruleset update through JMX. For example on WebSphere Application Server see Mapping the resAdministrators group to the Monitor role [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.config/config_ds_res_was8/tsk_was_map_admin_group.html] 
 * Version mismatch between the Execution Unit(s) and the Management Console: in order for the Management Console to detect the presence of execution units the versions of these components must match down to the fix level. For example 7.1.1.4 Management Console would not interact properly with a 7.1.1.3 Execution Unit. The version of the RES console is displayed in the "About" link (top right corner). The version of the Execution Unit can be seen in the resource adapter ra.xml file where a resourceadapter-version tag shows the version. For example with the WebSphere Application Server this can seen through: Resources > Resource adapters > XU > Deployment Descriptor 
 * Asynchronous ruleset parsing is used : in this mode, while an updated ruleset is being parsed, an earlier version of the ruleset can be used for executions that are requested at that time. Note that there is no guarantee of which specific earlier version of the ruleset may be used since it is a factor of which versions are available in the deprecated ruleset cache and whether garbage collection has occurred. In order to remove any uncertainty on the version that can be executed, it is possible to either turn off the asynchronous mode [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.res.managing/topics/tsk_res_config_asynchron_turnoff.html], or force synchronous parsing in asynchronous mode [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.res.managing/topics/tsk_res_config_forcing_sync_pars.html]. 
 * Notification scope is limited to one cell : by design the RES notification mechanism only works within one WebSphere Application Server Cell ( or one JBoss domain, or one Weblogic domain ), so a Management Console may only notify Execution Units that are running on servers in the same cell as the RES Console. See XU notification in a cluster over multiple cells [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21458245]. If you need to implement notifications to several cells at once, the document Ruleset updates and programmatic notification of RES eXecution Unit [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21418646] can be useful. 
 * Parsing failure of an updated ruleset : leading the XU to fall back on an earlier active version that parses successfully 
 * Ruleset update was only written to persistence: writing directly to RES persistence with the ant tasks res-write-db or res-write-file [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.res.managing/topics/tsk_res_deploy_rlapp_ant.html] does not trigger a notification, so the update may only been seen after server restart. 
 * XU MBean is not activated in Java SE mode : See Activating the XU MBean in Java SE [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.res.managing/topics/tsk_res_config_xu_mbean_jse.html] 
 * Multiple Java SE Execution Units are deployed in the same JVM: See Rule Execution Server J2SE mode hot deployment does not seem to work [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21585251]

5.1 Before installing the fix
-----------------------------
- The prerequisites listed under section 3.1 entitled 'Upgrade prerequisites 
for this fix' must be installed when for upgrade.

- For the purpose of this README, the symbol <CANDLEHOME> is the 
IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory. The default value
for CANDLEHOME is '/opt/IBM/ITM' on UNIX systems and 'C:\ibm\itm'
on Windows systems.

- If you have customized the Monitoring Agent for Sybase Agent 
oy.ini file on UNIX system, this file should be backed up before the fix 
install. After this fix is installed, edit the latest oy.ini file and merge 
your modifications into this oy.ini file.


5.2 Local agent install and update (including silent installation)
--------------------------------------------------------------
1. Transfer the appropriate archive file (CNN25ML.tar.gz or .iso) to a temporary 
directory on the system that contains the agent code to be updated. 
For the purpose of this README, the symbol <TEMP> represents the fully 
qualified path to this directory.
Note: On Windows, this includes the drive letter. 

2. Expand the archive file using the tar command on UNIX systems or 
an unzip utility on Windows systems. This creates a directory 
structure that contains fixes for all of the supported platforms.

3. Use the procedures in the "ITCAM for Applications, Version 7.2.1.2 
Installation and Setup Guide" to install the agent.

4. Use the procedures in the specific database monitoring agent user's
guide to complete the installation and configuration.

5. After agent upgrade bitness of agent binary should be same as pre-upgrade on x86-64 
bit windows. Agent do not support upgrade to 64 bit binary.


5.3 Remote agent update and installation
----------------------------------------
1. Transfer the appropriate archive file (CNN25ML.tar.gz or .iso) to 
a temporary directory on the IBM Tivoli Enterprise 
Monitoring Server system. For the purpose of this README, the 
symbol <TEMP> represents the fully qualified path to this directory.
Note: On Windows, this includes the drive letter. 

2. Expand the archive file using the tar command on UNIX systems or an 
unzip utility on Windows systems. This creates a directory structure
that contains fixes for all of the supported operating systems.

3. To add the fix pack bundles into the remote deploy depot, use the
tacmd addBundles command found in $CANDLEHOME/bin on UNIX systems
or in %CANDLE_HOME%\bin on Windows systems. For more information
on the tacmd addBundles command, see Appendix A. Commands reference
of the "IBM Tivoli Monitoring Administrator's Guide."

On a UNIX system: if the fix was expanded to 
<TEMP>/CNN25ML:
> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>/CNN25ML/WINDOWS/Deploy -t oy -f
> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>/CNN25ML/unix -t oy -f 

where:
-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to be
added to the depot.
-t is the product code of the product to add, in this case or 
represents the Monitoring Agent for Sybase Agent
-f performs the actions without asking for confirmation

On a Windows system: if the fix was expanded to 
<TEMP>/CNN25ML:
> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>\CNN25ML\WINDOWS\Deploy -t oy -f
> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>\CNN25ML\unix -t oy -f 

where:
-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to be
added to the depot. 
-t is the product code of the product to add, in this case oy 
represents the Monitoring Agent for Sybase Agent
-f performs the actions without asking for confirmation

5. To log in to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring server, and deploy
the fix to the appropriate nodes where the agent is running, use
the following tacmd commands. For more information on the
tacmd login and updateAgent commands, see Appendix A. Commands
reference of the "IBM Tivoli Monitoring Administrator's Guide."

On a UNIX system: 
> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>
-u <itmuser> 
-p <password>

> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems

The output shows the managed system name for the OS agent on the 
remote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the
tacmd updateAgent command. 

> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd updateAgent -t oy 
-n <Managed system name>
-v 062002000

On a Windows system:
> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd login -s <server>
-u <itmuser> 
-p <password>

> %CANDLE_HOME%/bin/tacmd listSystems

The output shows the managed system name for the OS agent on the 
remote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the
tacmd updateAgent command. 

> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd updateAgent -t OY 
-n <Managed system name>
-v 062002000

If there are not prior version koy agent on remote system .Then use 
below tacmd addSystem command.

> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd addSystem -t OY 
-n <Managed system name> 
-p INSTANCE="<Sybase instance name>"

Note:
- The <Sybase instance name> is the Sybase agent instance name to be monitored on 
remote system.
- The component (-t) for the updateAgent command is specified as 
two characters (oy), not three characters (koy).
- The node (-n) for the updateAgent command is the managed system
name of the operating system (OS) agent to be updated. The 
target node for an updateAgent command is always an OS agent.
-Remote installation will fail if the MTEMS window is open on the agent machine.

5.4 Agent support update
------------------------
Use the following steps to update the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring 
Server, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal
Desktop:

1. Transfer the appropriate archive file (CNN25ML.tar.gz or .iso) to 
the IBM Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Servers, IBM Tivoli
Enterprise Portal Servers or Tivoli Enterprise Portal desktops. 

2. Expand the archive file using the tar command on UNIX systems or an 
unzip utility on Windows systems. 

3. Use the procedures in the "ITCAM for Applications, Version 7.2.1.2
Installation and Setup Guide."

4. Use the procedures in the specific database monitoring agent user's
guide to complete the installation and configuration.

5. If the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server being updated is remote (not a 
Hub Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server) then restart the Tivoli Enterprise 
Monitoring Server.



6.0 Additional installation information
=======================================
6.1 Verifying the update
-------------------------
1.To verify whether the agent is updated correctly, use the tacmd command to
view the current version of the agent after the agent is restarted. Ensure that
you log on to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server before you view the agent
version.
For example,

On UNIX systems, where $CANDLEHOME is the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation
directory, the default location is /opt/IBM/ITM.

> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>
-u <itmuser> 
-p <password>
> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems -t OY

On Windows systems, where %CANDLE_HOME% is the IBM Tivoli Monitoring
installation directory, the default location is C:\IBM\ITM.

> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd login -s <server>
-u <itmuser> 
-p <password>
> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd listSystems -t OY

Note:
The component (-t) for the tacmd listSystems command is specified as two
characters (OY), not three characters (KOY).

When the agent is updated, the agent version is changed to 06.20.02.00.
After the agent is restarted, you can also use the GUI to verify whether the
agent was updated. For the agent on Windows systems, the version number is
06.20.02.00.

2.To verify whether the agent support files are updated correctly, use the
kincinfo command on Windows systems or the cinfo command on Linux or UNIX
systems.

On UNIX or Linux systems:
To validate that all components have been installed, run the following command:
$CANDLEHOME/bin/cinfo -i

Sample output for the cinfo command on a UNIX or Linux systems

7.0 Known problems and workarounds
==================================
Problem: Sybase agent configuration is not working using itmcmd manage 
command from GUI on Solaris 11
Workaround:
For Solaris 11:
Run './itmcmd config -A oy' present at location:<CandleHome>/bin

Problem: Prereqchecker which is integrated with the installer fails on 
windows platform.
Workaround: 
For Windows:
Run on command prompt ‘prereq_checker.bat KOY’ present at location:
InstallerPath\Sybase_Agent_Installer\WINDOWS\prereqchecker

For Unix:
Run ‘./prereq_checker.sh KOY’ present at location:
InstallerPath\Sybase_Agent_Installer\unix\prereqchecker

Problem: Registry entries are not cleared when agent is uninstalled on 64 bit
windows platform.
Workaround: Delete registry entries manually from path:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Candle\KOY\610\

Problem: When running the verification step in the "itmcmd config -A oy"
function on a Solaris 10 system, the following output from the verification
program is produced: "user needs read authority to".
Workaround: Issue "ps -ef | grep koyagent" to locate the koyagent process and
issue "kill -9" for that process. Check the Navigator tree in the Tivoli
Enterprise Portal for an offline koyagent entry and clear the offline entry.
The Monitoring Agent for Sybase Server that was configured by "itmcmd config" 
is unaffected by this problem. 

Problem: When running multiple remote deploys and agent upgrades, a task
timeout occurs during either the remote deployment or the agent upgrade. 
Workaround: Restart the OS Agent following the task timeout and before
performing the next remote deployment or agent upgrade.

Problem: If you are installing this fix into a depot on a Windows computer, and
WinZip(R) is used to extract this fix, text files in the depot might contain
CTRL-Ms. When this fix is remotely deployed to a UNIX machine from the Tivoli
Enterprise Monitoring Server or depot on Windows, the installation fails. The
CTRL-Ms are caused by extracting the fix using WinZip with "TAR file smart
CR/LF conversion" option enabled. This extraction causes WinZip to put CTRL-Ms
in text files when they are extracted on UNIX through remote deployment. 
Workaround: If you are using WinZip for the fix installation for the Tivoli
Enterprise Monitoring Server on Windows, disable the default "TAR file smart
CR/LF conversion" option. 

Problem: In the Tivoli Enterprise Portal, the instance name is displayed
instead of the host name in the Navigation tree. 
For example the Navigation tree might look like this,
MySid
Sybase
Alert Log
...
instead of this,
MyHost
Sybase - MySid
Alert Log
...

The problem is that the length of the managed node name, <SID>:<HOSTNAME>:SYB,
exceeds the length supported by the portal. A possible cause is that the
fully-qualified host name is being used. If 'uname -n' on the Monitoring Agent
for Sybase Server computer returns a fully-qualified host name, then this host
name is the cause. 
Workaround: Override the host name with an appropriate shorter name by adding
the following line to oy.config: 
export COLL_HOSTNAME=<short name>


8.0 Additional product information 
==================================
Steps for enabling SDA (Self-describing agent)
For Windows:
1.On the computer where the monitoring server is installed, in the Manage
Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Services application, right-click the agent and 
select Advanced→ Edit ENV file.
2.Edit the existing environment variable to: TEMA_SDA=Y.

For UNIX:
1.On the computer where the monitoring agent is installed, change to the
<Install_dir>/config/ directory.
2.Open the coordinating file:
For single-instance agents: <pc>.ini 
For multi-instance agents: <pc>_<instance>.ini file 
Where pc is the two-character product code.

 IBM Security Network Protection firmware 5.3.1 release notes - United States release notes; readme; firmware; xgs FIX README

ABSTRACT
 IBM Security Network Protection Firmware Version 5.3.1 is a firmware update for the XGS NGIPS network protection platform. This release provides the following updates to IBM Security Network Protection Firmware Version 5.3.1. 

CONTENT
Serviceability and support enhancements: 

 * You can now get additional information about your system through the command line within your "Tools" directory. We have added the Sysinfo command that will display system CPU, memory, and storage information in command line interface (CLI).
   Note: A complete list of CLI commands are located in the Command-line interface [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHLHV_5.3.1/com.ibm.alps.doc/references/alps_command_line_interface.htm] section in the Knowledge Center.
   
 * New to this release we have added a services mode within CLI. These commands will allow you to restart key services within the appliance. These services are listed below:  * Packet processing 
    * Packet Capture 
    * Local Management Interface (LMI) 
    * License and Update (LUM) 
    * SiteProtector Communication
      
   
   
 * You can now view and search logs from the command line using the "less" and "tail" commands from within logs mode. Log files found using the less command are System, Webserver, Updates and Analysis logs. 
   
 * With the admin-sftp account you can now retrieve Snapshots, Packet Captures, and support files. This account uses the same password as the admin account. 
   Note: More details on admin-sftp can be found in the Downloading files with an SFTP client [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHLHV_5.3.1/com.ibm.alps.doc/tasks/alps_downloading_sftp.htm]documentation on the Knowledge Center. [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHLHV_5.3.1/com.ibm.alps.doc/tasks/alps_downloading_sftp.htm]


Response enhancement:  * Forwarded events (Remote Syslog Alert Responses) will show the same details as the content sent to SiteProtector. 
 * Support for using the TCP protocol when creating Remote Syslog Alert Responses to prevent messages being truncated and improve delivery reliability over using UDP.


Network Access Policy enhancement:  * You can now use the network access policy to control network access when the HTTP X-Forward-For (XFF) header is enabled. The network policy can use the XFF header along with the packet source to control network traffic.


IPS Policy enhancements:  * You can now derive a new IPS object from an existing IPS object by right-clicking on an IPS object and left-clicking on Clone.
   
 * When enabling network, transport-layer, and status events in a non-default IPS object, a warning message is shown. This will help to minimize what may be seen as a false negative.


Performance:  * Inspection throughput increase for XGS 7100 up to 25Gbps, FPL5 (25Gbps) added.


Miscellaneous updates and implementation changes:  * Top 10 URLs and URL categories widget in the Local Management Interface have been disabled by default. Given the limited popularity of this feature, coupled with the performance impact in certain situations, we disabled the feature by default. You can re-enable it by using the advanced parameter tune.url.topten.tracking=true. 
   
 *  We have removed the MultiCast Domain Name System (mDNS), under some configurations it caused security risks within the appliance.
   
 * Support for mutual certificate authentication for communication between the Network Security appliance and SiteProtector.


Known issues: 
You can find a list of known issues for IBM Security Network Protection 5.3.1 in Technote 1715537: Known issues for IBM Security Network Protection version 5.3.1 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21715537].

 IBM Use"isolate the resource provider" to establish data source connections using a different JDBC driver from the same database vendor - United States isolate this resource provider TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Customer has defined 3 Oracle JDBC Providers at cell, node and server
scope. Client have following configuration in websphere JDBC provider. 

In Cell Scope - C:\jdbc\ojdbc5\ojdbc5.jar 

In Node Scope - C:\jdbc\ojdbc6_g\ojdbc6_g.jar 

In Server Scope- C:\jdbc\ojdbc6\ojdbc6.jar 

In this case value of JDBC driver path in WebSphere variable is identical. Nornally, If JDBC provider configure at server level then server level driver will get load first. But in this case since all three drivers are from same vendor, So we can not control which driver is picking up. In this case 
"C:\jdbc\ojdbc6\ojdbc6.jar" should be loaded first but instated, ojdbc5.jar was load first

[13. 4. 5 12:05:15:625 KST] 00000023 CompoundClass < loadClass 

oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver 

loader=com.ibm.ws.bootstrap.ExtClassLoader@5dc95dc9 

source=file:/C:/jdbc/ojdbc5/ojdbc5.jar Exit 






SYMPTOM
Due to multiple JDBC drivers from the same vendor were configured in different scopes, the wrong driver class was loaded.


CAUSE
When multiple versions of the JDBC driver are configured in WebSphere Application Server, irrespective of the scopes, there is a possibility of a collision of the classes and we cannot predict from which version of the driver jar the class got loaded. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 In order to support the existence of multiple versions of the driver jars, the "Isolate this resource provider" configuration helps to ensure there are no conflicts. This needs to be configured on each JDBC Provider. You cannot isolate only one resource provider, all the provider configurations in different scopes will have to be configured with the "Isolate this resource provider" setting. In this scenario, the resource provider classes from different versions of the jars are not imported or accessed to verify if the isolation has indeed worked. In order to use the server-scoped resource provider the datasource using the server-scoped jdbc provider will have to be referenced from the application after isolating the resource providers and using a resource reference in the application. 


Go to the JDBC Provider and enable "isolate the resource provider". When "Isolate this resource provider" is enabled, it ensures that only the jar that was specified in the classpath will be used for all the datasources under that particular JDBC provider.

 IBM How to change Siebel connection settings using the  siebel.properties file in WebSphere Adapter for Siebel eBusiness Applications - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 The Siebel connection of WebSphere Adapter for Siebel eBusiness Applications is established with the default settings. You may need to modify the connection settings, such as connection timeout, according to your product environment. 

ANSWER
Siebel adapter uses the Siebel API (Java Data Bean) to interact with the Siebel server. The Siebel API also provides a way to configure the connection settings on the client side.
Create a siebel.properties file and save it in the classpath of the adapter (For example, <adapter project>\connectorModule) and restart the adapter and broker to pick up the settings to establish the required connections.

This is applicable for all supported brokers.

A detailed description of the Siebel.properties file is given below:

Siebel.properties File 

The siebel.properties file, which is located in your classpath, can be used to provide default parameters for client applications connecting to Siebel applications using the Java Data Bean. 

The table below shows the properties in the siebel.properties file. 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21366662&amp;aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21366662&amp;aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21366662&amp;aid=1] Property Type Property Description Siebel Connection Manager Connection properties siebel.conmgr.txtimeout Indicates the transaction timeout (in milliseconds). Defaults to 600000 = 10 minutes. siebel.conmgr.poolsize Indicates the connection pool size. Connection pool maintains a set of connections to a specific server process. Defaults to 2. Max connection pool size is 500. siebel.conmgr.sesstimeout Indicates the transaction timeout (in seconds) on the client side. Defaults to 2700 = 45 minutes. siebel.conmgr.retry Indicates the number of open session retries. Defaults to 3. siebel.conmgr.jce



siebel.conmgr.virtualhosts Indicates the usage of Java Cryptography Extension. 1 for jce usage and 0 for no usage.

A listing of virtual servers representing a group of like servers that perform the same function, for example, call center functions.

An incoming login for the call center Virtual Server will try servers from the list in a round-robin fashion.

An example of such a list follows:

VirtualServer1=sid1:host:port,sid2:host:port...;VirtualServer2=...

where:

Virtual Servers = an assigned list of real Siebel Servers with host names and port numbers (of the local SCB). Siebel Generated code for JCA/JDB properties siebel.connection.string Specifies the Siebel connection string. siebel.user.name Specifies the user name to be used for logging in to Object Manager. siebel.user.password Specifies the password to be used for logging in to Object Manager. siebel.user.language Specifies the user's preferred language. siebel.user.encrypted Specifies whether the username and password is encrypted. siebel.jdb.classname Specifies the default JDB classname Java System Properties file.encoding Indicates the code page on the client side. For example, cp1252, utf8, unicodeBig, cp942. NOTE: Java System Properties are System Properties, not Siebel Properties. 

The following is a sample siebel.properties file: 

siebel.connection.string = siebel.tcpip.rsa.none://test.siebel.com/siebel/sseobjmgr_enu/test 

siebel.conmgr.txtimeout = 3600 

siebel.conmgr.poolsize = 5 

siebel.conmgr.sesstimeout = 300000

CAUSE
Installation Manager is an Eclipse Rich Client Program application based on the open source project found at http://www.eclipse.org [http://www.eclipse.org]. Eclipse changed the window system requirement from motif to gtk on UNIX operating systems. For AIX, this Eclipse window system change requires the gtk libraries to be installed to support the GUI. For Installation Manager, the GUI is the wizard mode of operation. 

You can use Installation Manager without the gtk libraries. For information on console mode, command-line mode, or silent mode; see the Installation Manager Information Center [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/install/v1r6/topic/com.ibm.cic.agent.ui.doc/topics/c_modes.html]. Silent mode uses a response file and command-line mode is supported by all packages. For console mode, check your product documentation to verify that the product supports console mode.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To use the GUI, the gtk+ RPM and dependencies must be available on AIX. 


Install this set of RPMs on AIX:


atk-1.12.3-2.aix5.2.ppc.rpm
cairo-1.8.8-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm
expat-2.0.1-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm
fontconfig-2.4.2-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm
freetype2-2.3.9-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm
gettext-0.10.40-6.aix5.1.ppc.rpm
glib2-2.12.4-2.aix5.2.ppc.rpm
gtk2-2.10.6-4.aix5.2.ppc.rpm
libjpeg-6b-6.aix5.1.ppc.rpm
libpng-1.2.32-2.aix5.2.ppc.rpm
libtiff-3.8.2-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm
pango-1.14.5-4.aix5.2.ppc.rpm
pixman-0.12.0-3.aix5.2.ppc.rpm
xcursor-1.1.7-3.aix5.2.ppc.rpm
xft-2.1.6-5.aix5.1.ppc.rpm
xrender-0.9.1-3.aix5.2.ppc.rpm
zlib-1.2.3-3.aix5.1.ppc.rpm

The installed RPMs must be of the minimum versions listed above.

To install the RPM versions specified above take the following steps: 


 1. Download the gtk2_bundle_v2.tar package [ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/aix/freeSoftware/aixtoolbox/ezinstall/ppc/] (version 'v2') containing all the RPMs and the install script to a new directory. 
    
    
 2. Decompress the tar file. 
    You can use the command tar -xvf gtk2_bundle_<version>.tar to decompress the file.
    
    
 3. Open the decompressed directory gtk2_bundle_<version> and run the install.sh script.
    
    The script will check if the required RPMs are installed at the compatible level. If they are not, the script will prompt to install the compatible versions.
    
    
 4. Verify the environment variable LIBPATH contains a path to the installed libraries. 
    For example LIBPATH=/opt/freeware/lib/


Note that if you download and install RPMs individually, we have found that the following libraries are incompatible:  * glib2-2.14.6-2 and gtk2-2.10.6-5

1.0 General description
=======================
This fix resolves the APARs and defects listed in the "Problems Fixed"
section below. 

2.0 Problems fixed
==================
2.1 APARS:
-------------------
APAR: IJ00433
Abstract: The collector process is crashing while accessing invalid
parameter of the request. 
Additional Information: Customized SQL query result attribute group
(KOQCSQLR) request uses 3 parameters & other attribute groups use 2
parameters. The memory for the third parameter was not handled properly.
And accessing this parameter by other attribute group would result
into crash.

APAR: IJ00815
Abstract: Device Detail attribute AUTOGROWTH behaviour not in sync
with SQL Server. 
Additional Information: In case when data file autogrowth was disabled
and max-size was set to unlimited, then the incorrect values were
displayed for filegroup detail attribute(Max Growth Size) and device
detail attribute(Growth).

APAR: IJ01540
Abstract: False alerts are being generated as default value "Not
Collected" for "Database Space Pct Used" attribute is not correctly
converted before sending to TEPS.
Additional Information: Situations having default value
[ Not Collected (-1 ) ] in formula were not getting evaluated correctly
for some database detail attributes. However, the data was shown
correctly as ‘Not Collected’ on the portal.

APAR: IJ05451 
Abstract: ITCAM SQL Server Agent's collector process crashes when using
SQL Server Native Client 10.0 or SQL Server Native Client 11.0 as
ODBC driver.
Additional Information: Collector was not able to handle all possible values
returned by ODBC when using SQL Server Native Client 10.0 and SQL Server
Native Client 11.0 causing it to crash.

2.2 DEFECTS:
-----------------
DEFECT: 170986
Abstract: Memory leak in Table Detail attribute group. 
Additional Information: Memory leak observed in Table Detail attribute
group because incorrect de-allocation handling. 

DEFECT: 170987
Abstract: Crash observed in Availability group details attribute group
and Table detail attribute group
Additional Information: Crash observed in Availability group details
attribute group and in Table detail attribute group for the wrong
usage of iterator after erase. Issue happened because an attempt to
increment the iterator was made after the iterator was deleted through
erase function. 

DEFECT: 170993
Abstract: intial size > max size gives incorrect values
Additional Information: If a database was created with restricted growth
and then modifed the initial size of the database file to a value
greater than it's maxsize, then the value of maxsize was not updated
correctly (ideally in this case maxsize should become equal to initial
size). As a result, query to SQL Server returned false value for
maxsize due to which incorrect values were getting displayed on portal
for attributes in Database Detail, Device Detail and Filegroup Detail
attribute groups.

DEFECT: 170994
Abstract: Incorrect value displayed for Database Detail attributes
when autogrowth disabled and data freespace > drive freespace.
Additional Information: In cases when data file autogrowth was disabled
and data freespace was greater than device freespace then incorrect
value were seen for some attributes(Data Freespace , Aggregate Database
Freespace , Database Space pct used , Aggregate Database Freespace pct,
Database max growth size). 

DEFECT: 171127
Abstract: Add tolerance support for SQL Server 2017.
Additional Information: Added support for SQL Server 2017 version.

DEFECT: 171244
Abstract: Spelling mistake in agent configuration panel.
Additional Information: Few spelling mistakes in agent configuration
panel were corrected.

DEFECT: 171318
Abstract: Usage of KOQ_ODBC_DRIVER variable in pre-req while making
sql server connection.
Additional Information: During pre-requisite check, the value of
‘Driver’ was hardcoded to ‘SQL Server‘. While later on, for collecting
data value for 'Driver’ was picked from ‘KOQ_ODBC_DRIVER’ variable.
Due to this, issue was seen during pre-requiste connection but later
on data was being collected successfully.

DEFECT: 171379
Abstract: High Severity vulnerabilities are resolved to avoid undefined
behaviour of the agent.
Additional Information: Removed the high severity errors in the code,
detected in CPPCheck tool.

DEFECT: 171785
Abstract: DBD_TEMP rename failed with error [32]
Additional Information: Renaming of DBD_TEMP to DBD_PREV files was
failing with Error 32 (The process cannot access the file because it
is being used by another process)because DBD_TEMP file handle was
taking time to close. 

DEFECT: 171979
Abstract: Incorrect value is being sent when query is failed in SRV1
cursor.
Additional Information: Zero value was being sent when query fails in
SRV1 cursor which was incorrect. Zero is a meaningful value which does
not indicate failure.

DEFECT: 171981
Abstract: Not Collected value is frequently sent since database
detail collection is not getting completed in 45 seconds.
Additional Information: When database detail collection took more
than 45 seconds for collection, Not collected values were sent which
resulted into triggering of situation.

DEFECT: 172173
Abstract: Environment setting for COLL_DBCC_NO_LOCK was not taking
effect. Similar issue was seen with COLL_MONITOR_ALL_DATABASES.
Additional Information: Values were getting overwritten for above two
variables, hence queries were running without NoLock hint and monitoring
of all database setting was not working as expected.

DEFECT: 173699
Abstract: No data get collected for server summary attribute group.
Additional Information: SRV3,one of the pre-cursor of server summary
attribute group, was failing as its query was executed with (null)
option. Hence no data was collected for server summary attribute group.

DEFECT: 174076
Abstract: MSSQLQA: Sometime server detail data is not getting displayed
on portal.
Additional Information: SRV3, one of the pre-cursor of server summary
attribute group, was failing as its query was executed with (null)
option. Hence sometimes server detail data was not getting displayed
on portal.

DEFECT: 174077
Abstract: crypted SQL password in log file.
Additional Information: Encrypted password value in logfile is 
replaced with fixed length string to avoid security breach.

DEFECT: 174420
Abstract: Last Statistics Query execution failing for table details
attribute group.
Additional Information: Due to query failure,table detail data was
collected only for the first time. From second collection onwards,
new data was not collected & portal always showed the data collected
during first collection.

DEFECT: 175117
Abstract: Table detail attribute group query was failing for syntax error
at where clause and returned null
Additional Information: The query which gets executed while include/exclude
databases is on, was containing two consecutive "where" and hence 
was failing. This issue is seen with SQL Server 2014 and above versions. 

DEFECT: 175120
Abstract: Data is not collected properly with the non default SQL
ODBC driver.
Additional Information: Due to incorrect size calculated for some
data types, either query’s result set processing was failing or the
data was getting truncated. As a result data was not getting collected
properly for some attributes.

2.3 Enhancements:
-----------------
RFE: 50594
Abstract: Support AlwaysOn feature for SQL developers edition.
Additional Information: Added support for SQL Server Developers
Edition's AlwaysOn feature.

5.0 Installation instructions
=============================
This fix can only be installed over an existing installation. 
Use the following steps to install this fix.

5.1 Before installing the fix
-----------------------------
- The prerequisites listed under section 3.1 entitled 'Prerequisites
for this fix' must be installed before this fix can be installed.

- With reference to this README, the symbol <CANDLEHOME> is the
IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory. The default value
for CANDLEHOME is '/opt/IBM/ITM' on UNIX systems and 'C:\IBM\ITM'
on Windows systems.

Before installing this fix on UNIX systems, set the environment
variable CANDLEHOME to the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation
directory.

For example:
> CANDLEHOME=/opt/IBM/ITM
> export CANDLEHOME

- Refer to section 7.0 entitled "Known problems and workarounds"
before installation.

- Because there is no uninstall utility for this fix, make sure to
perform a backup of your environment before installing this fix.

5.2 Local agent update
----------------------
1. Transfer the appropriate archive file
(6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001.tar or .zip) to a temporary directory
on the system that contains the agent code to be updated. For
the purpose of this README, the symbol <TEMP> represents the
fully qualified path to this directory.
Note: On Windows systems, this path includes the drive letter.

2. Expand the archive file using the "tar" command on UNIX systems
or an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a
directory structure that contains fixes for all of the 
supported platforms.

3. Use the "itmpatch" command to install the fix for that agent
platform. For more information on the "itmpatch" command, see
section 6.2.

On Windows systems, if the fix was expanded to
<TEMP>\6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001, the install command is:

For 32 bit Agent:
> <TEMP>\6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME>
-i <TEMP>\6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\KOQ_winnt_tema_if0001.cab

For 64 bit Agent:
> <TEMP>\6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> 
-i <TEMP>\6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\KOQ_wix64_tema_if0001.cab

Note : Use "itmpatch" command from <TEMP>\6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\ 
temporary directory.

5.3 Remote agent update
-----------------------
1. Transfer the appropriate archive file
(6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001.tar or .zip) to a temporary directory
on the IBM Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server system. For the
purpose of this README, the symbol <TEMP> represents the fully
qualified path to this directory.
Note: On Windows systems, this path includes the drive letter.

2. Expand the archive file using the "tar" command on UNIX systems
or an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a 
directory structure that contains fixes for all of the 
supported platforms.

3. To add the agent fix bundles into the remote deploy depot, use
the "tacmd addBundles" command found in $CANDLEHOME/bin on UNIX
systems or in %CANDLE_HOME%\bin on Windows systems. For more
information on the "tacmd addBundles" command, see the IBM Tivoli
Monitoring Administrator's Guide.

On UNIX systems,
if the fix was expanded to <TEMP>/6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001:
> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd addBundles -n -i <TEMP>/6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001

On Windows systems,
if the fix was expanded to <TEMP>\6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001:
> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd addBundles -n -i <TEMP>\6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001

where:
-n indicates that prerequisite bundles are not automatically
added. The -n parameter must be used because the fix 
directory does not contain any prerequisites that the fix
might require. Please see Section 3.1 for the prerequisites
for this fix.
-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to 
be added to the depot. 

4. To log in to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring server, and deploy
the fix to the appropriate nodes where the agent is running, use
the following "tacmd" commands. For more information on the
"tacmd login" and "tacmd updateAgent" commands, see "IBM Tivoli 
Monitoring Command Reference".

On UNIX systems: 
> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>
-u <itmuser>
-p <password>

> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems

The output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the
remote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the
"tacmd updateAgent" command.

> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd updateAgent -t OQ -n <Managed system name> -v 063113001

On Windows systems:
> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd login -s <server>
-u <itmuser>
-p <password>

> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd listSystems

The output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the
remote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the
"tacmd updateAgent" command.

> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd updateAgent -t OQ -n <Managed system name> -v 063113001

Note:
- The component (-t) for the "tacmd updateAgent" command is 
specified as two characters (oq), not three characters (koq).
- The node (-n) for the "tacmd updateAgent" command is the
managed system name of the operating system (OS) agent to be
updated.
The target node for the "tacmd updateAgent" command is always
an OS agent.

5. To check if Remote Agent Update is SUCCESS/INPROGRESS/FAILED use the command 
>tacmd getDeployStatus -g <transaction id>

where transaction id is the id provided after updateAgent command.

5.4 Agent support update
------------------------
Use the following steps to update the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring
Server, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, or Tivoli Enterprise
Portal Desktop.

1. Transfer the appropriate archive file
6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001.tar or .zip) to the Tivoli 
Enterprise Monitoring Servers, Tivoli Enterprise Portal
Servers, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktops.

2. Expand the archive file using the "tar" command on UNIX systems
or an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a 
directory structure that contains fixes for all of the supported
platforms.

3. Expand the archive file (koq_tems_teps_tepd_if0001.tar or .zip)
that contains the updates for Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring
Server, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, and Tivoli Enterprise
Portal Desktop using the "tar" command on UNIX systems or an 
extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a 
directory structure that includes a subdirectory called CD-ROM,
with the necessary updates.

4. Use the Application Support Installer(ASI) script to launch either 
GUI installation or silent installation of the application 
support files. 

Note: For IBM Tivoli Monitoring Version 6.3 or above, one
of the following additional steps must be performed.

1. Acquire a platform-specific pre-packaged JRE version 
of the Application Support Installer (ASI). See IBM 
Tivoli Monitoring Application Support Installer, 
6.2-TIV-ITM_ASI-IF0002 at 
http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034924 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034924]
for download and installation instructions.

2. Specify the '-j javahome' parameter with the path to 
a java(r) 1.5 or java 1.6 installation when running 
the itmasi.sh or itmasi.bat script described below. 

GUI installation option
------------------------
The GUI can be started by using one of the following commands
from within the CD-ROM directory where setup.jar is located.

On UNIX systems:
> ./itmasi.sh [-h <CANDLEHOME>] [-j <JAVAHOME>] 

On Windows systems:
> itmasi [-h <CANDLEHOME>] [-j <JAVAHOME>] 

where:
-h <CANDLEHOME> - Required. The path to the IBM Tivoli
Monitoring installation directory.

-j <JAVAHOME> - Optional. The fully-qualified path to the
"bin" directory where Java(R) is installed.
The location of Java on your system might
vary.

When prompted by the Application Support Installer for the 
installable media directory, select the CD-ROM directory, not
the component directory. The installer can install updates for 
multiple components at the same time.

Silent installation option
--------------------------
To use the silent installation option, use one of the following
commands from within the CD-ROM directory where setup.jar is 
located. 

Note: Agent support upgrade for IBM Tivoli Monitoring Version 6.3 
or above on Linux, zLinux, Solaris and windows operating systems 
requires the following files contained in interim fix 
6.2-TIV-ITM_ASI-IF0002. This is applicable to both GUI and 
silent installation option of agent support upgrade.
- Linux: setupLinux.bin
- zLinux: setupLinux390.bin
- Solaris: setupSolaris.bin
- Windows: setupwin32.exe

Follow the installation instructions contained in the
"6.2-TIV-ITM_ASI-IF0002.README".

On UNIX systems:
> ./itmasi.sh -h <CANDLEHOME>[-silent] 
[-r <response file>] 
[-j <JAVAHOME>] 

On Windows systems:
> itmasi -h <CANDLEHOME> [-silent] 
[-r <response file>] 
[-j <JAVAHOME>] 

where:
-h <CANDLEHOME> - Required. The path to the IBM Tivoli
Monitoring installation directory.

-r <response file> - Required. Customized response file name.
The default response file "response.txt" in
the CD-ROM directory can be copied and
modified as per your environment.

-j <JAVAHOME> - Optional. The fully-qualified path to the
"bin" directory where Java(R) is installed.
The location of Java on your system might
vary.

5. The next panel presented by the Application Support Installer 
asks for the selection of which Tivoli Monitoring components
you want to add application support to.
For this fix, the check boxes should be set as follows:

Checked - Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server(TEMS)
Checked - Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server(TEPS)
Checked - Tivoli Enterprise Desktop Client(TEPD)

Continue through the remaining GUI panels selecting the
Microsoft SQL Server 06.31.13.01 support to complete the
installation.

Note: When support is installed using CLI or GUI for any of the
above Tivoli Monitoring components, they are restarted. 


6. If the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop or Tivoli Enterprise
Portal Browser was running when the update was installed, it
must be restarted.


6.0 Additional installation information
=======================================
Any existing Microsoft SQL Server Agent instances should be restarted
after the installation of this fix.

6.1 Installation instructions for agent baroc file
--------------------------------------------------
Fix (6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001) includes changes to the agent
baroc files which need to be reinstalled. If you have already
installed these baroc files, there are no additional installation
steps. If not, refer to IBM Tivoli Monitoring, Installation
and Setup Guide under "Installing monitoring agent baroc files
on the event server" in "Installing the IBM Tivoli Enterprise
Console Event Synchronization" section for more information.

6.2 Additional information on using "itmpatch" command
----------------------------------------------------
The "itmpatch" command has the following syntax.

Usage: itmpatch -h <installation home> [OPTIONS]

itmpatch -h <installation home>
-t { <patch_file_directory> | <patch_file> }

itmpatch -h <installation home>
-i { <patch_file_directory> | <patch_file> }

where:
-h Specifies the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory
-i Specifies the path to the directory or patch file to be 
installed
-t Generates a report of the actions to be taken by the patch

For example, on UNIX systems:
- To preview the fix installation, use the "-t" option:
> <CANDLEHOME>/bin/itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> -t <TEMP>

- To install the fix, use the "-i" option:
> <CANDLEHOME>/bin/itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> -i <TEMP>

where:
<CANDLEHOME> is the fully qualified IBM Tivoli Monitoring 
installation directory. On Windows systems, this path must include
the drive letter.
<TEMP> represents the fully qualified directory specification where
the fix is located. On Windows systems, this must include the drive
letter.

6.3 Verifying the update
------------------------
1. To verify the agent was updated correctly, use the "tacmd" command
to view the agent's current version after the agent is restarted.
You are required to log in to a Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring
Server prior to viewing the agent version.

For example:
On UNIX systems, where $CANDLEHOME is the IBM Tivoli 
Monitoring installation directory, the default location
is '/opt/IBM/ITM'.

> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>
-u <itmuser>
-p <password>
> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems -t OQ

On Windows systems, where %CANDLE_HOME% is the IBM Tivoli
Monitoring installation directory, the default location
is 'C:\IBM\ITM'.

> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd login -s <server>
-u <itmuser> 
-p <password>

> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd listSystems -t OQ 

Note:
- The component (-t) for the tacmd "listSystems" command is 
specified as two characters (OQ), not three characters (KOQ).

When the agent update is successful, the agent version is:
06.31.13.01.

After the agent is restarted, you can also use the GUI to verify
the agent was successfully updated.
For the agent on Windows systems, the version number is 
06.31.13.01.

2. To verify the agent support files were updated correctly, use 
the "kincinfo" command on Windows systems or the "cinfo" command
on Linux or UNIX systems. The sample output below shows the 
versions of the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, Tivoli 
Enterprise Monitoring Server, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal
Desktop systems after this fix has been successfully applied.

Note: The displayed build date and installation date might not 
be accurate. This is known problem.

On UNIX or Linux systems:
-------------------------
To validate that all components have been installed, run the
following command:

./cinfo -i

On Windows systems:
-------------------
To validate that all components have been installed, run the
following command:

For example:
> %CANDLE_HOME%\InstallITM\kincinfo -i

C:\Users\Administrator>kincinfo -i

 IBM Unable to decrypt the FIPS key error when exporting keys from IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture - United States dcskey gnk; dc_KTF.xml TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When attempting to generate and/or export keys using the dcskey command, you receive the error, "Keys couldn't be exported. Unable to decrypt the FIPS key" 

CAUSE
Enabling the Use FIPS compliant algorithms for encryption, hashing and signing security policy can cause this error

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To allow the keys to be exported properly: 

 1. Select Local Security Policy under Administrative tools 
 2. Navigate to Local Policies - Security Options 
 3. Select System Cryptography: Use FIPS compliant algorithms for encryption, hashing and signing and be sure it is Disabled 
 4. Run dcskey e again to export the key

The error does not affect application functionality. Disabling SessionObjectSize counter makes the error stop occurring. 

CAUSE
WebSphere® Application Server Session Manager throws NotSerializableException when it tries to serialize non-serializable SessionData from the application before sending it to PMI.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The application needs to ensure there is no session object that is not serializable. The object needs to implement java™.io.Serializable interface.

 IBM Too Many Open Files error message - United States wasrun; wasjdk; open; files; too; ProblemDeterminationDocument; JCC was appserver app server TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote explains how to debug the "Too many open files" error message on Microsoft Windows, AIX, Linux and Solaris operating systems. 

SYMPTOM
The following messages could be displayed when the process has exhausted the file handle limit: 

java.io.IOException: Too many open files

[3/14/15 9:26:53:589 EDT] 14142136 prefs W Could not lock User prefs. Unix error code 24.

New sockets/file descriptors can not be opened after the limit has been reached. 


CAUSE
System configuration limitation.

When the "Too Many Open Files" error message is written to the logs, it indicates that all available file handles for the process have been used (this includes sockets as well). In a majority of cases, this is the result of file handles being leaked by some part of the application. This technote explains how to collect output that identifies what file handles are in use at the time of the error condition.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM




Determine Ulimits

On UNIX and Linux operating systems, the ulimit for the number of file handles can be configured, and it is usually set too low by default. Increasing this ulimit to 8000 is usually sufficient for normal runtime, but this depends on your applications and your file/socket usage. Additionally, file descriptor leaks can still occur even with a high value. 

Display the current soft limit:
ulimit -Sn

Display the current hard limit:
ulimit -Hn

Or capture a Javacore, the limit will be listed in that file under the name NOFILE:
kill -3 PID


Please see the following document if you would like more information on where you can edit ulimits:
Guidelines for setting ulimits (WebSphere Application Server)
http://www.IBM.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg21469413 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg21469413]


Operating Systems 

Windows By default, Windows does not ship with a tool to debug this type of problem. Instead Microsoft provides a tool that you can download called Process Explorer [http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653]. This tool identifies the open handles/files associated with the Java™ process (but usually not sockets opened by the Winsock component) and determines which handles are still opened. These handles result in the "Too many open files" error message. 

To display the handles, click on the Gear Icon [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21067352&amp;aid=1] in the toolbar (or press CTRL+ H to toggle the handles view). The icon will change to the icon for DLL files (so you can toggle it back to the DLL view). 

It is important that you change the Refresh Rate. Select View > Update Speed, and change it to 5 seconds. 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21067352&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21067352&aid=2] 

There is also another Microsoft utility called Handle that you can download from the following URL: 
https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896655.aspx [https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896655.aspx] 

This tool is a command line version of Process Explorer. The URL above contains the usage instructions. 


AIX 
The commands lsof and procfiles are usually the best commands to determine what files and sockets are opened.. 

lsof 
To determine if the number of open files is growing over a period of time, issue lsof to report the open files against a PID on a periodic basis. For example: 

lsof -p [PID] -r [interval in seconds, 1800 for 30 minutes] > lsof.out 

This output does not give the actual file names to which the handles are open. It provides only the name of the file system (directory) in which they are contained. The lsof command indicates if the open file is associated with an open socket or a file. When it references a file, it identifies the file system and the inode, not the file name. 

It is best to capture lsof several times to see the rate of growth in the file descriptors. 

procfiles 
The procfiles command does provide similar information, and also displays the full filenames loaded. It may not show sockets in use. 

procfiles -n [PID] > procfiles.out 


Other commands (to display filenames that are opened) 

INODES and DF 
df -kP filesystem_from_lsof | awk '{print $6}' | tail -1 
>> Note the filesystem name 
find filesystem_name -inum inode_from_lsof -print > filelist.out 
>> Shows the actual file name 

svmon 
svmon -P PID -m | grep pers (for JFS) 
svmon -P PID -m | grep clnt (for JFS2, NFS) 
(this opens files in the format: filesystem_device:inode) 

Use the same procedure as above for finding the actual file name. 


Linux To determine if the number of open files is growing over a period of time, issue lsof to report the open files against a PID on a periodic basis. For example: 

lsof -p [PID] -r [interval in seconds, 1800 for 30 minutes] > lsof.out 

The output will provide you with all of the open files for the specified PID. You will be able to determine which files are opened and which files are growing over time. 

It is best to capture lsof several times to see the rate of growth in the file descriptors. 


Alternately you can list the contents of the file descriptors as a list of symbolic links in the following directory, where you replace PID with the process ID. This is especially useful if you don't have access to the lsof command: 

ls -al /proc/PID/fd 


Solaris Run the following commands to monitor open file (socket) descriptors on Solaris: 

pfiles 
/usr/proc/bin/pfiles [ PID ] > pfiles.out 

lsof 
lsof -p [ PID ] > lsof.ou t 

This will get one round of lsof output. If you want to determine if the number of open files is growing over time, you can issue the command with the -r option to capture multiple intervals: 
lsof -p [PID] -r [interval in seconds, 1800 for 30 minutes] > lsof.out 

It is best to capture lsof several times to see the rate of growth in the file descriptors. 

HP-UX 
lsof 
lsof -p [ PID ] > lsof.out 

This will get one round of lsof output. If you want to determine if the number of open files is growing over time, you can issue the command with the -r option to capture multiple intervals: 
lsof -p [PID] -r [interval in seconds, 1800 for 30 minutes] > lsof.out 

It is best to capture lsof several times to see the rate of growth in the file descriptors.

 IBM Restoring missing xml files from backup in DASH - United States DASHL2; DASHL2FAQ; restore; backup; xml; WEB-INF TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How can I restore missing or corrupted xml files in the WEB-INF directory, (such as the navigation.xml, portletEntities.xml, etc.) from backup in Dashboard Application Service Hub (DASH) ? 

CAUSE
Some of these files could have gotten corrupted. 

ANSWER
DASH makes a backup copy of the WEB-INF configuration/custom xml files in the backups directory. These files are very useful if any of these files get corrupted. 

Please follow below steps to restore files from the backups directory: 

1. Stop the DASH server 

2. Make a backup copy of the current xml files in the following directory: 

<JazzSM_Home>/profile/config/cells/JazzSMNode01Cell/applications/isc.ear/deployments/isc/isclite.war/WEB-INF 

3. Go to <JazzSM_Home>/profile/backups and find a backup file from a previous day/time that contains the missing xml files 

Example: isc_stores_backup_1427324004938.zip 

4. Unpack the zip file to a temporary location. 

5. Restore these files in the WEB-INF directory from the backup. 

6. Start DASH 

7. Test if you can access the DASH Portal.

TBSM agent packages are available for download from the TBSMAgent
directory on the support download site. The TBSMAgent code was last
updated with TBSM 6.1.1 Fixpack 1


=======================================================================

2.0 Hardware and software requirements
----------------------------------

For information about hardware and software requirements, see the
Tivoli Business Service Manager Installation Guide on the IBM
Tivoli Business Service Manager Information Center (at IBM Knowledge Center):

http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc/welcome.htm [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc/welcome.htm]

To apply this Fix Pack you will need 3 GB of disk space. Please check
the amount of space you have before you install, as the installation
will fail if you run out of space.


=======================================================================
3.0 Installation information
------------------------

3.1 Dependencies

This Fixpack must be installed on each server(s) that is running 
the TBSM data server or TBSM dashboard server.

This Fixpack requires IBM Tivoli Business Service Manager 
Version 6.1.1 to be installed.

3.2 Prerequisites
-------------

Tivoli Integrated Portal 2.2.0.15 version 2 (v2) has been certified. It
can be installed after installing this fix pack.

IBM strongly recommends updating to TIP FP 2.2.0.15 v2, if support is
required for FF ESR 31 and IE11. If the TBSM data server and dashboard 
server are installed on different machines, the TIP Fix Pack needs to be 
installed only on the dashboard server. In case of a TIP HA environment, 
the HA nodes need to be disjoined first before upgrading to TIP FP.

See Fix Central for availability:
http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~Tivoli&product=ibm/Tivoli/Tivoli+Integrated+Portal&release=2.2.0.15&platform=All&function=all [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~Tivoli&product=ibm/Tivoli/Tivoli+Integrated+Portal&release=2.2.0.15&platform=All&function=all]

Post installation of TIP 2.2.0.15 v2 requires a re-start of the
Dashboard server and clearing of all user's browser cache!

3.3 Special considerations
----------------------

Consider this information before you install the Fix Pack:
1. You will be prompted during the installation to specify a backup
directory name. The installer backs up DE at this location.

2. This Fixpack does not backup the entire application. It only
backs up the files that it has updated/replaced. A backup copy of the
original files can be retrieved from:
[InstallDirectory]/tipv2/logs/tbsm/maintenance/backup/6.1.1.0/FP0003

3. The TBSM and TIP processes or services may remain running but, will 
be re-started during the Fix Pack install process. If the processes
or services are manually stopped, prior to the Fix Pack install,
please make sure both the OMNIbus Object server and DB2 processes or
services remain running!

NOTE: The installer will start/stop the TBSM and TIP services as
needed, during the install process.

On Linux/Unix: perform the following

1. To stop the TBSM Data server issue the following command:

$TIP_HOME/profiles/TBSMProfile/bin/stopServer.sh server1 
-username <adminuser> -password <adminpassword> 

2. To stop the TBSM Dashboard server, issue the following 
command:

$TIP_HOME/profiles/TIPProfile/bin/stopServer.sh server1 
-username <tipadminuser> -password <adminpassword> 

By default, username is tipadmin and password is the 
tipadmin password.

3. To stop the TBSM Discovery Library Toolkit issue the 
following command:

$TBSM_HOME/XMLtoolkit/bin/tbsmrdr_stop.sh 

On Windows:

1. In the Start menu, click Settings -> Control Panel
-> Administrative Tools -> Services.

The Services window opens. Depending on what services 
you have installed, the available services are as follows: 

Tivoli Business Service Manager - TBSMProfile_Port_17310. 
This is the Data server. 
Tivoli Integrated Portal - V2.2_TIPProfile_Port_16310.
This is the Dashboard server. 
Tivoli BSM Discovery Library toolkit 
EIF probe 
This service appears only if the EIF probe was installed 
as a Windows service. 

2. Right-click the service that you want to stop and click Stop.


4. All non-vital programs should be closed prior to installation of 
the Fixpack.

6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0001 is superceded by this Fix Pack.
6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0002 is superceded by this Fix Pack.


3.5 Extracting Fix Pack files
-------------------------

3.5.1 Extracting on Linux, Solaris, Linux for System z, and AIX 
platforms

1. Copy the file 6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0003-<ARCH>.tar to a temporary
location on your TBSM Server.

2. Unpack the file on each host where you need to install the Fix
Pack using these commands:

tar -xvf 6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0003.<ARCH>.tar


3.5.2 Extracting on Windows platforms
-------------------------------

1. Copy the 6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0003-windows.zip file to a temporary
location on your TBSM server host.

2. Unzip the file on each server where you need to install the Fix Pack.


3.5.3 Fix pack directories
--------------------

When you extract the file, these directories are created: 

TBSM -TBSM data server and dashboard server and TIP updates.

DiscoveryLibrary -Discovery Library Toolkit updates

<ARCH>/Reports

Samples


3.6 Maintenance upgrade strategy
----------------------------

Before you install the Fix Pack, you need to plan how and when you will
upgrade each TBSM server in your environment. 


3.6.1 Example maintenance scenario
----------------------------

In this example, the maintenance is staged into two phases to
reduce the time required for the TBSM maintenance window.

In this example environment, there are four servers: 
* primary data server
* backup data server
* two dashboard servers set up for load balancing called: dash1
and dash2

Follow this sequence:

Before you start the maintenance window: 
1. Upgrade backup data server
2. Upgrade one dashboard server (for example dash2)
3. Use the primary data server and dash1 for regular production
activities

After you complete the upgrade the two secondary servers, start
the maintenance window down time for the production servers.
1. Upgrade primary data server
2. Upgrade dash1

After you complete the upgrade for all the servers: 
1. Start primary data server
2. Start backup data server
3. Wait until TBSM completes the server synchronization.
4. Start the dashboard servers. 


3.7 Installation
------------


3.7.1 Installing the Fix Pack
-----------------------

[Fix Pack] Refers to the directory where you extracted the Fix
Pack files from the zip/tar file.

Attention: Install the Fix Pack with the same user that was
used to install TBSM 6.1.1 GA


NOTE: If you have deployed the Service Level Objectives (SLO) 
Reporting Function, you must do the following before
installing the Fix Pack:

- Stop all Impact services that are running policies that
call the SLO functions to record data in the SLORPRT
database. If you have the service set to start at
server startup, then turn this option off before
installing the fixpack, as the server is restarted
during the fixpack install.

Running the install without DE backup:

If you prefer to backup DE with your own procedures you can
run the install with the following parameter.

-DNO_BACKUP=true

(for Silent Install, uncomment the "NO_BACKUP=true" 
parm on the setupFP.rsp response file)

If you choose this method, you must backup DE before you install.
And restore the original system using your backup/restore
procedures or utilities (if uninstalling the Fix Pack).

Follow this procedure to install the Fix Pack:

1. On the Tivoli Business Service Manager server host, change to the
[Fix Pack]/TBSM directory where you extracted the files.
2. Run the installation using one the following commands:
* setup-windows.exe - Windows.
* setup-<unixplatform>.bin - other operating systems.

Installation command options:

GUI mode No options, for example: 
Windows: setup-windows.exe

or

UNIX® : ./setup-<unixplatform>.bin 

Console mode
Use the -i console option. 
For example -
Windows: setup-windows.exe -i console

or 

UNIX® : ./setup-<unixplatform>.bin -i console

Silent Mode

a. Copy setupFP.rsp from the TBSM directory of the extracted
Fix Pack file ([Fix Pack]/TBSM) to a location it can be
edited (/tmp).
b. Update the file to match your environment.
c. Confirm acceptance of license, by un-commenting this line
and setting the parm to "true":
#LICENSE_ACCEPTED=false
d. Run:

Windows: setup-windows.exe -f C:\tmp\setupFP.rsp

or 

UNIX® :setup-<unixplatform>.bin -f /tmp/setupFP.rsp

Note: The response file needs to have a fully qualified
path.

3. During the install you will be asked to to verify
path names to the TIP install.

4. Restart both the Data and Dashboard processes/services

5. After install is complete (and with the data server started), run
the script ApplyPoliciesFor611FP3, which can be found on the Data
Server under $TBSM_HOME/bin. This script loads the new/updated
policies.

NOTE: Do not run the ApplyPoliciesFor611FP3 on the secondary/
backup data server of a failover pair. This only needs to
be run on the primary data server.

On Windows:

ApplyPoliciesFor611FP3.bat <adminuser> <adminpassword>
For example - ApplyPoliciesFor611FP3.bat tipadmin tipadmin

On Linux/Unix:

./ApplyPoliciesFor611FP3 <adminuser> <adminpassword>
For example - ./ApplyPoliciesFor611FP3 tipadmin tipadmin 

NOTE: Verify that the admin user id and password are
correct otherwise, the script will fail at the last step.

If incorrect, rerun the script with a valid adminuser id
and password.

6. From the TBSM 6.1.1 Fix Pack 3 install media, copy these files
onto the DB2 server (where the tbsmdb was initially installed,
when TBSM was first setup).

from: [Fix Pack]/TBSM/TBSMDBChecker
to: [InstallDirectory]/tbsmdb/bin

TBSM_Check_DB.bat
TBSM_Check_DB.sh
tbsmDatabaseChecker.xml
TBSMDBChecker.props

NOTE: The above action is only needed if you ever plan to use
the TBSM_Check_DB script, which will now suppress the
display of the requested user password.

7. After installing this Fix Pack, end-users may need to clear their
browser cache, close and re-open the browser; in order to avoid
any issues on the client side.

8. If the Impact "Service Level Objectives (SLO) Reporting"
function was enabled, please refer to section 3.12 for additional
post Fix Pack installation required actions.

9. Please refer to section 4.0 "Additional information for TBSM Fix Pack 3 APARS"
for additional post install actions.


3.7.2 Discovery Library Toolkit
-------------------------

1. Navigate to the DiscoveryLibrary directory.

2. To install Fixpack 3, 

If you are on a Windows operating system, run the following
command from a prompt: 

setup-dltoolkit-6.1.1-FP0003-windows_64.exe

If you are on a Unix operating system, run the following
command from a prompt:

setup-dltoolkit-6.1.1-FP0003-<unixplatform>_64.bin

For console mode, specify "-i console".

Note: If the installer cannot find the TBSM 6.1.1 Discovery 
Library Toolkit, verify that the toolkit is installed and 
that it was installed by the user that the fixpack is being 
installed with. If these are both okay, then set the environment
variable TBSM_TOOLKIT_BASE to the location of the toolkit and 
restart the toolkit installer. For example: 
Windows:
set TBSM_TOOLKIT_BASE=C:\Program Files\IBM\tivoli\tbsm\XMLtoolkit
UNIX:
export TBSM_TOOLKIT_BASE=/opt/IBM/tivoli/tbsm/XMLtoolkit

3. The toolkit installer requires access to the database.


4. Notes and Post-Install Considerations:

a) After installation is complete, you may remove
[fixpack] to save space.

5. Restart the toolkit.


3.8 TBSM agent
----------

Installing the TBSM agent (last updated with TBSM Fix Pack 1):

The following packages are available for download in the TBSMAgent
directory on the support download site:

* AIX: KR9_aix526CD-6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0001.tar.gz -AIX (64 bit) 

* Linux: KR9_lx8266CD-6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0001.tar.gz -Li x86_64R2.6(64 bit)

* Solaris: KR9_sol286CD-6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0001.tar.gz -Solaris R8(64 bit)

* Windows: KR9_wix64CD-6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0001.zip -(64 bit)

* zLinux: KR9_ls3266CD-6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0001.tar.gz -Li S390R2.6(64 bit)


To install the updated TBSM agent (FP1), if not already installed:
1. Download the appropriate agent code for your platform.
2. Untar or unzip the file.
3. Install the agent according to the directions in the TBSM
Installation Guide. This is a complete install package for the TBSM
agent support and can be used for a fresh install of the agent.

For instructions on installing and configuring the TBSM agent, see:

http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc/installguide/bsni_agent_ic_install_config.html [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc/installguide/bsni_agent_ic_install_config.html]


3.9 Uninstalling the Fix Pack
-------------------------

Before uninstalling the FixPack all TBSM processes should be
STOPPED. The user must manually stop the TBSM processes, before 
the uninstall of the FixPack (except for OMNIbus and DB2).

Attention: Uninstall the Fix Pack with the same user that was used to
install TBSM 6.1.1 GA.

Silent mode and uninstall


If silent mode was used for the install, the uninstall will
default to a silent uninstall and you must supply a response
file or the uninstall will fail.

For silent mode uninstalls, copy the setup_uninstall.rsp file
from the Fix Pack image to the directory:

<installDir>/tbsm/_uninst/TBSM611_FP3

and update the file with the correct information. Then launch
the installer specifying the file. For example:

uninstall(.exe) -f /tmp/setup_uninstall.rsp

Note: The response file needs to have a fully qualified path.

On the Tivoli Business Service Manager server system:

1. Change to the directory: 
<installDir>/tbsm/_uninst/TBSM611_FP3

2. Run the uninstall command:

UNIX: If you are on a Unix operating system, run the following
command from a prompt.

./uninstall


Windows: If you are on a Windows operating system, run the following
command from a prompt.

.\uninstall.exe

For console mode, specify "-i console"

3. After the command has completed, run the following commands to clear
the server cache.

Linux/AIX: <TIP_HOME>/bin/clearClassCache.sh

Solaris: java -Xshare:dump

Windows: <TIP_HOME>\bin\clearClassCache.bat



4. Uninstall eWAS 7.0.0.35

NOTE: On a "Data server only" environment, the TBSM 6.1.1 Fix
Pack 3 un-installer will not remove the upgraded eWAS
7.0.0.35 Fix Pack it installed. If there are plans to, at
a future time, re-install TBSM 6.1.1 Fix Pack 3, it is
necessary to manually un-install eWAS 7.0.0.35. 

These steps DO NOT apply to a "Dashboard sever only"
environment or a "Single server" environment, where both the
Data and Dashboard are installed together.

Again, these steps are only needed on a "Data server only"
environment. Failure to perform these actions, will prevent
the re-install of TBSM 6.1.1 Fix Pack 3!

a). Copy the uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt to a temporary location
The uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt file is located on:
<installdir>/tbsm/_uninst/TBSM611_FP3/plan/install/MachinePlan_localhost/00002_WASFP/uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt

For example on Unix:
/opt/IBM/tivoli/tbsm/_uninst/TBSM611_FP3/plan/install/MachinePlan_localhost/00002_IAGLOBAL_COI_STEP_WASFP/uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt

For example on Windows:
C:\IBM\tivoli\tbsm\_uninst\TBSM611_FP3\plan\install\MachinePlan_localhost\00002_IAGLOBAL_COI_STEP_WASFP\uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt


Or from the TBSM 6.1.1 FP3 install media:

Discovery Library Toolkit
===================================================

The Toolkit portion of this fixpack cannot be uninstalled.
A backup copy of the original files can be retrieved from:

[InstallDirectory]/tbsm/
XMLtoolkit/log/install/maintenance/backup/611FP0003



3.10 Recovering from a failed Fix Pack install
-----------------------------------------

If the install fails, try to uninstall in which case, it goes back to
the previous version. If there is no uninstall file under 
_uninst/TBSM611_FP3, then nothing really got installed and you can delete
the TBSM611_FP3 file and reinstall.


3.11 Restoring failed DE upgrade from backup
---------------------------------------

To recover a failed Deployment Engine upgrade in TBSM 6.1.1, see the
TBSM Installation Guide at: 

http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc/installguide/bsmi_upgrade_t_restore42.html [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc/installguide/bsmi_upgrade_t_restore42.html]


3.12 "Service Level Objectives (SLO) Reporting" function
---------------------------------------------------


The information in this section applies only if you have deployed
the Impact Solution called "Service Level Objectives (SLO)
Reporting". The SLO function is enhanced by Fixpack 3 for:

* Support of a time zone specification when creating the SLA
definitions

* Detection of active outages in the sample policy that reads
from a TBSM Metric History database

* Bug fixes and improved documentation

For this function, See the 'SLO Reporting' topic under Impact
6.1.1 at the following url:

http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSHYH_6.1.1.3/com.ibm.netcoolimpact.doc/solution/imsg_slo_reporting_c.html [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSHYH_6.1.1.3/com.ibm.netcoolimpact.doc/solution/imsg_slo_reporting_c.html]

If you have NOT deployed this solution, then you can skip this
section!


After installing the Fixpack, but BEFORE restarting any SLO services:

1) Update the SLORPRT database schema

a) You will need access to the machine where the SLORPRT
database was installed. If this database has not been
installed, then the SLO solution has not been deployed
and there is no need to continue this update to the
schema.

b) If necessary, copy files add_timezone.sql and
update_views_timezone.sql from 
[InstallDirectory]/impact/add-ons/slo/db
to a location accessible from the system you will use
to update the database schema in the next step.

c) Open a DB2 command window on a system with access to
the SLORPRT database and run the following commands:

db2 connect to SLORPRT user dbuser using dbpassword
( replace dbuser and dbpassword with the
user/password specified in datasource
SLOReportDatasource )

db2 -tvf <slo_sql_dir>/add_timezone.sql

db2 -tvf <slo_sql_dir>/update_views_timezone.sql

db2 connect reset

Where <slo_sql_dir> would be 
[InstallDirectory]/impact/add-ons/slo/db if on the 
same machine as the Impact Data server, or the directory
where you copied the files in step b if the SLORPRT
database is on a different machine


2) Once the Fixpack is installed and the SLORPRT database
schema has been updated, you should start any Impact
services configured for SLO processing. Remember to check
the option to start the service when the server starts,
if that is how you originally configured the service.

4.0 Additional information for TBSM Fix Pack 3 APARS:
------------------------------------------------

The following APARs fixed in this service delivery require additional
action by users. If your environment uses or is experiencing the
symptoms described, use the instructions provided to complete the fix.

4.1 IV30875 - ERROR CTGBC0053E WHEN SELECTING SERVICE IN A CANVAS
Customers are now allowed to persist their log file settings 
without manually editing the server.xml file. Currently, customers
use the setTraceLevel script to set the maximum number of log files
and the size of these of files using the following method:

$TBSM_HOME/bin/setTraceLevel.sh <user> <pw> data/dashboard -setTraceOutputToFile 30 40

Now they will be able to persist these sizes by using the following
command.

$TBSM_HOME/bin/setTraceLevel.sh <user> <pw> data/dashboard -setstartup

Before this change, the call would only persist changes to the trace
level. Now it persists changes to the trace level as well as the log
file configurations.


4.2 IV65545 - TBSMEVENTREADER STOPS BECAUSE EVENT PROCESSOR BLOCKING ON
RADEVENTSTORE

The following SQL statements needs to be run after FP install, against 
the TBSM DB2 Database:

CREATE INDEX RADEVENTSTORE_IDX1 ON TBSMBASE.RADEVENTSTORE(RADSERIAL) COLLECT STATISTICS

The above SQL statement can be found on the following file:

./tipv2/profiles/TIPProfile/installedApps/TIPCell/isc.ear/sla.war/install/AddRADEventStoreIndex.sql

Please provide the above file to the TBSM DB2 Database Administrator, 
along with the following Notes:

Notes: 
1) Use
cat AddRADEventStoreIndex.sql | db2
to run the SQL. The command must be run against all DB2 databases
used for TBSM. The command does not require a server stop/start.

2) The ; delimiter is not used in the AddRADEventStore.sql file
- whether the delimiter is required or not depends on the
connection settings (-t option).

3) Typical output from the SQL: cat AddRADEventStoreIndex.sql | db2
db2 => db2 => db2 => DB20000I The SQL command completed successfully.
db2 => db2 => DB20000I The SQL command completed successfully.
db2 => db2 => DB20000I The RUNSTATS command completed successfully.

4) Typical output from the SQL (if the index already exists)
db2 => db2 => DB20000I The SQL command completed successfully.
db2 => db2 => SQL0605W The index was not created because an index
"TBSMBASE.RADEVENTSTORE_IDX" with a matching definition already exists.
SQLSTATE=01550
db2 => db2 => DB20000I The RUNSTATS command completed successfully.

5) Other warning:
SQL2314W Some statistics are in an inconsistent state. The newly
collected "INDEX" statistics are inconsistent with the existing 
"TABLE" statistics. SQLSTATE=01650

To address the message above, RUNSTATS Is Run after the index is
created. 

As well as the changes in the index there are 2 
configurations changed required for this APAR

a) Increase the number of allowed connections for the TBSMDatabase 
Data Source.

This can be done via the Impact GUI screen (Data Model) or via
the file tbsm\etc\TBSM_TBSMDatabase.ds

Increase the number from default 15 to 50 (or to limit 
recommended by DB2 Admin)

TBSMDatabase.DB2.MAXSQLCONNECTION=15
to
TBSMDatabase.DB2.MAXSQLCONNECTION=50

If changing via file, then a Data Server restart is required.


b) Set the LOCKTIMEOUT in DB2 to 30 seconds. The default is -1, 
which mean no timeout - If you set this parameter to -1, lock 
timeout detection is turned off. Setting to 30 seconds means 
sessions will only wait for 30 seconds for a lock. Again, this 
change should be made in consultation with local DB2 
Administrator.

List of TBSM APARs that have updates to the documentation:

IV54828 GET REQUESTS FROM DASH WIDGETS TO TBSM DATA SERVER
There is a new property (impact.dataproviderupdateprocessorintervalsecs), that
defines the interval at which the data provider fires status change updates.

IV42339 CUSTOMER TRY SETTING THE PARM TO 'NULL' TURNS OUT THE DATASOURCE FILE WE SHIP FOR OUR OBJECT SERVER
The ObjectServer_DS.ObjectServer.FAILOVERPOLICY parm can be
changed (in the TBSM_HOME/etc/(TBSM or TBSM_B)_ObjectServer_DS.ds
file by either manually editing the file (as shown on the
Install Guide) or running this new command, with either of
the three listed values:

Windows:

%TBSM_HOME%\bin\tbsm_generic_ant_caller.bat ObjectServer_DS_config.ant <parm>


Unix:

$TBSM_HOME/bin/tbsm_generic_ant_caller.sh ObjectServer_DS_config.ant <parm>

Available values:
1. DISABLE - configure to only connect to Primary Object Server
2. FAILOVER - configure FAILOVER back and forth between Object Servers but,
only if connection is lost. This is the Default (if NULL' is used)
3. FAILBACK - configure to FAILBACK to Primary Object Server, as soon as it is available.

IV46098 MULTIPLE TADDM MSS ASSOCIATED WITH RESOURCES WHEN TBSM IS CONFIGURED TO WORK WITH TADDM CONFIGURED FOR FAILOVER

#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------
# (Optional) Specifies a alias for building MSS Id. By default,
# the TADDM hostname is used. But in cases there TADDM is
# configured in failover, objects imported from the Primary
# TADDM and Backup TADDM will have different hostnames 
# used for building MSS. This will mean 2 MSS associated
# with objects.
# 
# When setting a string for the alias, use the primary taddm 
# hostname.
#
DL_AliasForMSS = PrimaryTaddmHostname
#
# Note: Launch in Context uses the MSS hostname to build the 
# sourceContactInfo value, which is used to contact the TADDM 
# server. For this reason, when TADDM is configured in Failover, 
# a front end server (load balancer) is required, to route Launch
# In Context requests to the active server. This will ensure 
# requests are routed to the secondary TADDM server, when the 
# primary is down.

IV65503 ESDA DOES NOT CLEAN OLD SERVICE IDENTIFICATION FIELDS
The property "UseESDAIdentifiersOnly" can be added, as an
additional parameter to the child Template, which will allow
users to select if they want previous event identifiers on a
service to be kept or erased with each invalidation. 

When set to "true", all previous event identifiers will be 
erased from TBSM memory model at each invalidation and the
service will only accept identifiers from ESDA policies or via
SCR API. When set to "false", all event identifiers, old or
newly added will be preserved for the service. User must
manually delete event identifiers that they do not wish to
keep. This is TBSM's default behaviour. 

IV65786 TBSM CIRCULAR REFERENCES ISSUE
There will be two new properties added in TBSM_sla.props file
that governs the check:

Property name: impact.sla.servicetreedepthlimit
Description: When the data is imported from TADDM, a depth
limit check will be done to the corresponding service tree 
during invalidation to ensure that the service tree has normal
relationship data. This property governs the depth limit for
the service tree. If the system detects a service tree with
depth level larger than the value set by this property, a 
warning service instance will be created to warn the user to
review their data relationship.

Default value: 20

Property name: impact.sla.disableimportalldescendantslimitcheck
Description: When set to "true", the service tree depth limit
will not be checked during invalidation.

Default value: false

IV62246 DATA SOURCE FAILOVER SETTINGS CLASH BETWEEN TBSM AND IMPACT
The APAR handles the issue of TBSM Failover settings for Data
Sources. Impact back-end java code handled whether or not
failover (or failback) is initiated in times of Data Source
failure. This back-end Impact code only uses the 
FAILOVERPOLICY settings in the .ds files

The APAR change has been in the TBSM interfaces to setting up
Data Source. There are 2 interfaces 1) GUI screen (as above)
and 2 radshell (createDataSource and export functions). 

1) TBSM GUI: The TBSM GUI will now set the FAILOVERPOLICY
setting in the .ds file. When editing existing files, if
no valid FAILOVERPOLICY exists, then the current
DISABLEFAILOVER setting will be used to determine a new
FAILOVERPOLICY setting, i.e. if no valid FAILOVERPOLICY
exists, then if DISABLEFAILOVER is true, FAILOVERPOLICY 
will be set to DISABLED. If DISABLEFAILOVER is false,
FAILOVERPOLICY will be set to FAILOVER

Take good note of the above. It means that existing data
sources will have a new FAILOVERPOLICY set, when they are
first saved via the GUI. Previously if FAILOVERPOLICY was
not valid, Impact assumed FAILOVER. But if you edit a data
source, and the data source has DISABLEFAILOVER = true,
and no valid policy set, then the new value for
FAILOVERPOLICY is DISABLED. This is correct behaviour, but
different to before. The best was to avoid any confusion,
it to check each .ds file and ensure that a valid
FAILOVERPOLICY is set. Do this either by editing the files
(in which case a Data Server restart is required) or by
opening each data source in the GUI. Not all Data Sources
will appear in the GUI (as some are built in). For these,
check the files. If editing files, ensure no spaces at the
end of settings. The only valid values for FAILOVERPOLICY
are DISABLED, FAILOVER and FAILBACK.

2) radshell: The Radshell interface also changes. The export()
function will now export the failover policy, and the
createDataSource takes a policy parameter (in place of the
boolean disablefailover parameter), Also, the old
createDataSource radshell function, will still work (for
backward compatibility with old exports). Note: Data Sources 
exported with IV62246 in place, will NOT work on old
systems-as the generated radshell command will contain a
policy string.

List of Impact APARs that are marked as updates to the documentation:

IV20165: E-MAIL READER DELETES E-MAILS AFTER READING THEM
The email reader service reads incoming email, and runs
policies based on the contents of the email. To stop the
email reader from deleting emails after you read them, add the
following property to the <EmailReaderName>.props file.
<emailreadername>.deleteonread=false

Where <emailreadername> is the email reader service name.
Restart the service.This only works for IMAP email servers.

IV37369: OBJECT.PROTOTYPE.TOSTRING.CALL(OBJ) RETURNS {}
If a customer is using Object.prototype.toString.call(obj) in
a javascript policy, and wants to follow the javascript
standard, he can add the following property to
NCI_server.props file - 

impact.featureToStringAsSource.enabled=false

When the property is set to false, the data follows the
JavaScript standard and the data output by the Log function
is not the same as in IPL. To make the output the same in
JavaScript and IPL, make the value true but this does not 
follow the javascript standard.

IV38585: NCI_EXPORT NOT EXITING CLEANLY WHEN RUNNING ON A NON PRIMARY IMPACT
NCI_EXPORT restriction: nci_export will not execute on the
non-primary member of a cluster.

IV40158: ABILITY TO CHANGE NUMBER OF POLLING INTERVALS 
In order to make the readEventBuffer store the events for a
longer interval, the number of intervals can be updated. The
default number is 3.

Add the following property to the
<CLUSTERNAME>_<readername>.props. file 
(eg NCI_omnieventreader.props file)- 

impact.<readername>.numreaderbuffer=4

The default value for this property is 3.

IV40179: ERROR MESSAGES FIRST APPEAR ON 6.1 AND 6.1.1 DURING STARTUP, DUE TO THE FACT THE
NAMESERVER IS NOT INITIALISED YET
When the Impact Server is started during the installation,
the following message is displayed in the netcool.log file:

Unable to login to configured name servers host , port 

The message occurs because the Name Server can take time to
initialize while Netcool/Impact starts. You can ignore this
message. It is normal and it disappears when the Name Server
server is initialized.

IV43157: ALL SERVERS IN A CLUSTER ARE REQUIRED TO USE THE SAME ADMIN UID AND PASSWORD
If you are configuring the Tivoli® Integrated Portal profile
for a cluster of servers, you must use the same user name and
password for all the servers in the cluster.

IV50673: INCORRECT/UNCLEAR DOCUMENTATION FOR HANDLING EXCEPTIONS

IV50776: DURING UPGRADE WE WILL OVER WRITE ANY CUSTOMIZED MWM POLICIES WITH NEWER THE MWM DEFAULT POLICY'S VERSIONS

IV51431: NEED TO DOCUMENT THAT DOT NOATION CAN NOT BE USED IN THE NAMING OF POLICIES, SERVICES, DATA TYPES, DATA SOURCES, AND PROJECTS.
Documentation has been updated to note that Dot notation "." 
can not be used in the naming of POLICIES, SERVICES, DATA
TYPES, DATA SOURCES, AND PROJECTS.

IV52651: DATABASEREADER NOT WORKING PROPERLY WHEN USING GETUPDATES ON DATABASE TABLE'S TIMESTAMP FIELD
Database event reader service

An additional property can be added to the NCI_XXX.props file
in order to match the the date and time format of the
timestamp field in the external database. Where NCI is the
name of the impact instance and XXX is the name of the
database event reader. 

An example of this property is: 
impact.XXX.formatpattern=dd-MMM-yy hh.mm.ss.SSS aaa


5.4 Tivoli Integrated Portal

5.5 Jazz for Service Management (JazzSM)
------------------------------------

If JazzSM UI Services (DASH) is being used to visualize TBSM service model
data, then the latest JazzSM fix pack should be installed after installing this
TBSM FixPack. See Fix Central for availability:

http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~Tivoli&product=ibm/Tivoli/Jazz+for+Service+Management&release=All&platform=All&function=all [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~Tivoli&product=ibm/Tivoli/Jazz+for+Service+Management&release=All&platform=All&function=all]



=======================================================================
6.0 New support and features
------------------------

6.1 TBSM 6.1.1 Fixpack 3
--------------------
Fix Pack 3 includes the following enhancements:

1) Template Editor: sort items in "Rules" table

Adjusting the logic that handles the order of the rules displayed in
the table on the Rules tab. The following are the new rules each
of the columns will adhere to:

Type column
> use the same icon as the toolbar action that created the rule
> tooltips describe the rule's type

Rule Name column
> all rule names are now sorted A-Z 
> A-Z ordering maintained as rules are created and/or deleted 
> tooltips describe the rule's type; same as Type column
> the display order will not be customer configurable

Rule Settings column
> minor styling tweaks to assist readability

The above enhancement is specific to the TBSM console

2) Tree Template datasets: enable use of internal status attributes in
"Tree Template Editor"

Extended the capability of the Tree Template datasets by allowing
TBSM internal status attributes to be selected on the editor UI's
Template Rule Mapping section.

When Tree Template Viewed in TIP-based Service Tree

Without processing by the customization policy, these new status
attributes will display as the standard TBSM status values: 
0.0, 3.0, or 5.0. 

The above, enhances the TBSM Data Provider function and benefits
the DASH users.

3) Datasets need a parameter to optionally exclude "starting" or
"container" services.

With the addition of the Tree Template datasets in TBSM 6.1.1
Fixpack 1, we now have more situations where the administrator may
wish to exclude the starting or container service from a view.

The above, enhances the TBSM Data Provider function and benefits
the DASH users.

4) Support parameter to filter datasets in TBSM_Services datasource
by template

The parameter would be available on the datasets in the 
TBSM_Services datasource, which includes the "All_TBSM_Services"
and "TBSM_Urgent_Services" datasets

The above, enhances the TBSM Data Provider function and benefits
the DASH users.

5) "UrgentServices" dataset added

This new dataset makes the service model data that was displayed
in the legacy Urgent Services portlet available for display using
the List and Table widgets.

The above, enhances the TBSM Data Provider function and benefits
the DASH users.

6) Managing Dataset Dynamic Updates

All datasets available from the TBSM UI Data Provider automatically
send updates when the content changes. This is the recommended usage
of the TBSM datasets, but there may be scenarios where the user
would like to turn off the dynamic updating.

The above, enhances the TBSM Data Provider function and benefits
the DASH users.

More information can be found in the new "Dynamic Updating and the
TBSM UI Data Provider" document on the TBSM Advanced Topics page at
the TBSM developersWorks site

7) Tivoli Netcool/Impact provides new property to ascertain which Data
Provider field is used, when retrieving ITM data from the REST
Service

8) Enhancements to the Impact Solution called 
"Service Level Objectives (SLO) Reporting". The SLO function
is enhanced by Fixpack 3 for:

* Support of a time zone specification when creating the SLA
definitions

* Detection of active outages in the sample policy that reads from
a TBSM Metric History database

* Bug fixes and improved documentation


See the Advanced Topics at the TBSM developerWorks site for new and
updated information:

https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/Tivoli%20Business%20Service%20Manager1/page/Advanced%20Topics [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/Tivoli%20Business%20Service%20Manager1/page/Advanced%20Topics] 


6.2 TBSM 6.1.1 Fixpack 2
--------------------

1) NUMERICAL RULES NOT CALCULATED ON TBSM RESTART
Numerical Aggregation rules are triggered by a child metric rule
change, i.e. OverallAttribute. When the status of a child changes, the
OverallAttribute metric rule's value will change and any Numerical 
Aggregation rules, based on OverallAttribute, will be recalculated. 
When TBSM is restarted, only services which have related existing 
events will have their status recalculated. Therefore not all Numerical
Aggregation rules (based on OverallAttribute) will be recalculated on 
TBSM restart, as some services will be green. 

This may not be the desired outcome. On restart, it may be required
that all Numerical Aggregation rules are restarted. New functionality 
has been provided for such a scenario, by forcing a bubble up of state 
nodes. The code can be triggered from a policy, for leaf nodes
only, or for all, as shown here: 

USE_SHARED_SCOPE;

Type="StateModel";
Filter = "RECALCSTATENODESLEAF";
log("Recalc Leaf Node Only. Policy Start." );
GetByFilter(Type, Filter, false); 
log("Recalc Leaf Node Only. Policy Finish." );
}


USE_SHARED_SCOPE;

Type="StateModel";
Filter = "RECALCSTATENODESALL";
log("Recalc All Nodes. Policy Start." );
GetByFilter(Type, Filter, false); 
log("Recalc All Nodes. Policy Finish." );
}

The above policy code needs to be scheduled from Impact Services on
startup.



2) TBSM SLAM EVENTS ONLY GENERATED IF THE RULE OUTPUT CHANGES
If a client wants SLAM event text for a Numerical rule, to update
(even if it's value does not change), the following parm needs to be
un-commented and set to "true"

#If true then send SLAM events, even when the value of a Metric rule does NOT change.
#Default is false.
#Omnibus de-duplication will handle the rest.
#impact.sla.sendslameventsformetricrulealways=true



6.3 TBSM 6.1.1 Fixpack 1
--------------------

1) The BSM_Templates.radsh defines service templates for common TBSM services.
It was executed when you installed the TBSM GA release(not during the fixpack 
install). It's default template rules propagate child status to the parent 
service based on child template changes. The script has been updated to set 
the propagation type to instance propagation. When the child service status 
changes, it will propagate the change to the parent service regardless of
which child template rule caused the status change. See the Service 
Configuration publication for more information about the aggregation rule 
option.

To update the rules with the instance propagation option in your current 
installation, you can invoke the 
$TBSM_HOME/install/BSM_Templates_updatepropation.radsh script.

If you re-execute the $TBSM_HOME/install/BSM_Templates.radsh script 
to re-create the templates, the rules will be configured with 
the instance propagation option.


2) The recommended version of JRE plugin is Sun JRE 1.7.0_51 or 1.8 for 
Internet Explorer and Firefox.

3) Additional toolkit customization has been made. To pick up these
changes, run the following commands on the Data Server:

Windows:

cd %TBSM_HOME%\install
type BSM_TemplateUpdates611FP0003.radsh | %TBSM_HOME%\bin\rad_radshell

UNIX:

cd $TBSM_HOME/install
cat BSM_TemplateUpdates611FP0003.radsh | $TBSM_HOME/bin/rad_radshell

4) As noted in the following Technote, When configuring pages in DASH 
(JazzSM) for TBSM datasets, it is often desirable to create them
in a development environment and then later move them to
production, perhaps via a test environment. With this Fix Pack and
in conjunction with JazzSM 1.1 Fix Pack 2, there is no need to create
two connections any longer.

http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21660077 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21660077]

5) TBSM 6.1.1 Fixpack 1 will support the use of a rich hover function in
DASH (JazzSM). The TBSM UI data provider will now send the information
needed in order for a DASH user to configure a widget for rich hover 
support. To enable the rich hover in DASH you must:

Configure TBSM 6.1.1 to collect the registry information required to
support the rich hover in TBSM 6.1.1. This configuration is documented
at http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc/customization/bsmc_oslc_config_dataserverconfg.html [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc/customization/bsmc_oslc_config_dataserverconfg.html].
The rich hover option will not be available in DASH for widgets
configured with a TBSM dataset if the oslcconfig has not been run.

Configure DASH (UI Services) for access to JazzSM Registry Services.
Configuration of the required property is described at 
http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEKCU_1.1.0.3/com.ibm.psc.doc_1.1.0.3/tip_original/dash_t_twl_uipreview_resource_reg.html [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEKCU_1.1.0.3/com.ibm.psc.doc_1.1.0.3/tip_original/dash_t_twl_uipreview_resource_reg.html].

Note that if enabled in DASH, rich hover will be shown for the same
services that support the rich hover in the TBSM 6.1.1 console. If 
configured for a widget, and there is no rich hover information, 
then the flyover on the DASH widget will show nothing. Also note 
that the DASH environment requires Single Sign On be configured 
between the various components required to gather the preview 
information (DASH, TADDM, ITM, etc.)

6) TBSM 6.1.1 Fixpack 1 adds a new UI data provider data source that
provides new datasets corresponding to the customer's tree templates.
This allows the same data to be visualized in the legacy Service Tree
as well as on a JazzSM/DASH page.


6.4 Additional Browser Support with Fixpack 3

None!

6.5 Additional Browser Support with Fixpack 2
-----------------------------------------

TBSM 6.1.1 supports FF ESR 10 and FF17 with Fix Pack 1 on TIP 2.2.0.11 (or below).

This Fix pack supports Internet Explorer 9(IE9) in 
"Internet Explorer 9" browser mode which is the default mode, not 
in "Internet Explorer 9 Compatibility View" browser mode.
The document mode is automatically set by TIP and should remain
'IE7 standards'.

IBM strongly recommends updating to TIP 2.2.0.15 version 2 (v2) if
support is required for FF ESR 24/31 and/or IE10/11

See Fix Central for availability:
http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~Tivoli&product=ibm/Tivoli/Tivoli+Integrated+Portal&release=2.2.0.15&platform=All&function=all [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~Tivoli&product=ibm/Tivoli/Tivoli+Integrated+Portal&release=2.2.0.15&platform=All&function=all]



6.6 eWAS Fixes and Upgrades
-----------------------

Please Note: The TBSM 6.1.1 Fix Pack will upgrade WebSphere (eWAS) on the Data
server automatically, to version 7.0 Fix Pack 35 (7.0.0.35) but, only if the Dashboard
server is not installed on that environment. If the Dashboard server is installed on the
same server (in the case of a single server environment), the eWAS will not be upgraded.

eWAS upgrade, on the TBSM Dashboard server and on "Single server" environments, will
take place when TIP 2.2.0.15 is applied.

If un-installing TBSM 6.1.1 Fix Pack, refer to section 3.9 "Uninstalling the Fix Pack"
to manually remove eWAS 7.0.0.35 (on Data server only environments!).


6.7 OMNIbus 8.1
-----------
TBSM 6.1.1 Fix Pack 1 supports the use of OMNIbus 8.1. But, please note that
OMNIbus 8.1 is a separate install, requiring additional configuration changes to
make it work with TBSM. Refer to "IBM Tivoli Netcool OMNIbus Considerations" section
of the "Exploring TBSM" Guide:

http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc/installguide/bsmi_c_netcool_omnibus.html [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc/installguide/bsmi_c_netcool_omnibus.html]

If using OMNIbus 8.1, IBM recommends upgrading to the latest 8.1
maintenance level (at the moment, Fix Pack 2).

If using JazzSM/DASH to display TBSM resources, the Event Viewer and/or AEL may fail to display the appropriate
TBSM events if (1) a Data Source is not setup to point to TBSM's OMNIbus and (2) the custom TBSM filters and views are
not defined to WebGUI. To setup the WebGUI views, it will be required to copy the following file from
the TBSM Dashboard server to a temporary location on the JazzSM server:

<installdir>/tipv2/profiles/TIPProfile/installedApps/TIPCell/isc.ear/sla.war/install/webtopcore/create_tbsm_views.xml

In addition to copying the file to the JazzSM server, it is necessary to execute the runwaapi command, to load filters/views
the WebGUI. On the JazzSM/DASH server, execute the following command:

<installdir>/netcool/omnibus_webgui/waapi/bin/runwaapi -file create_tbsm_views.xml -user <admin> -password <password>

Please refer to the integration document found in "Advanced Topics"
at the TBSM developerWorks site, for this and other topics:

TBSM developerWorks Advanced Topics: https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/Tivoli%20Business%20Service%20Manager1/page/Advanced%20Topics [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/Tivoli%20Business%20Service%20Manager1/page/Advanced%20Topics]

6.8 DB2 
---
Starting with TBSM 6.1.1 Fix Pack 2, TBSM supports the use of DB2
version 10.5.3


6.9 TADDM 7.3 Integration
---------------------
For import of Business Applications from TADDM 7.3 to TBSM 6.1.1, the
property com.ibm.cdb.serviceinfrastructure.earlier.ver.compatibility
must be set to "true" in collation.properties file (located under
taddm/dist/etc). This will be true by default for upgraded TADDM 7.3
servers. It is false by default for fresh TADDM 7.3 installs. 

Note: TADDM restart is required after property modification.

If com.ibm.cdb.serviceinfrastructure.earlier.ver.compatibility is 
flipped from false to true, then all Business Applications need to be 
re-build, to regenerate backward compatible Business Applications. This 
can be done by either waiting for scheduler to process all Grouping 
Patterns (and recreate new and old Business Applications) or by manually 
executing (all or selected) Grouping Patterns from TADDM UI (or command
line).

7.0 Known issues - 
------------

7.1 Some date options in TBSM Reports do not work

When specifying the date parameters for reports, some options 
like "last 30 days" do not work. However, one can get this data
for the reports by selecting the Date Range and choosing the 
dates from the calendar. Below is a link to the TBSM reports in
our Service Configuration guide which outlines how to run reports.

7.2 Issues creating wire between Service Tree and Active 
Event List (AEL)

If the user creates a wire between the Service Tree and AEL
when a page is first created, the wire does not work. The
workaround for this is to create a wire by editing the page
after the page has been created and saved. 



7.3 TBSM Agent Chart title differs from name in the 
drop down list 

Name displayed at the top of a TBSM Agent Chart differs from
the name of that chart in the drop down list. For eg,
the chart name in the drop down list is "kr9_TBSM Service Status" 
and the name shown at the top of the chart is "Kr9:KR91003". 
The name at the top can be changed to display the same name 
as the drop down list by going to Preferences and changing 
the chart name.



7.4 Minimize-restore does not restore to correct size for
Service Navigation->Data/Data Fetchers on Internet Explorer(IE)9 

In the Service Navigation->Data/Data Fetchers portlet, after the 
minimize option has been exercised to minimize the portlet, the 
portlet is not resized correctly after using the 'restore' option.
The window resizes to a smaller size. This is an issue on
Internet Explorer(IE) 9 but not on Firefox or on Internet 
Explorer(IE) 8. In order to go back to the original size, 
select 'maximize' and 'restore'. 



7.5 Portlets covering content in a free form page

When creating free form pages, the Service Viewer and Active Event 
List(AEL) portlets will always be on top of any content. This can 
interfere with page layout and editing of portlet preferences. 
To alleviate this issue, it is best to place these portlets 
onto the created page last to avoid having other content covered 
by them. If a page requires editing and contains Service Viewer 
or Active Event List portlets, it may be necessary to move 
those portlets out of the way before editing preferences of 
other portlets.



7.6 Creation and deletion of Services and Templates that contain
special characters

Due to new security additions the deletion of services and templates
that contain the characters '+', '&', '<','>','%',' " ', is not
permitted through the browser. Some of these characters are
permitted on the creation of services, as services can still be
created with these through auto population and importing. The 
deletion of these services will now have to be carried out
through the radshell command deleteServiceInstance. 

More information on the command can be found here.

http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSPFK_6.1.0/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc_6.1/adminguide/bsma_shlr_service_delete.html [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSPFK_6.1.0/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc_6.1/adminguide/bsma_shlr_service_delete.html]




7.7 WEBSERVICES SECURITY NOT FUNCTIONAL
If using WebService Security when making a WebService call,
(callProps.EnableWSS=true), the jar file 
tipv2/plugin/org.apache.axis2.jar must be replaced by the jar
file tbsm/lib3p/org.apache.axis2-woden.jar and the newly replaced
file must be renamed to org.apache.axis2.jar.

Restart is required.

7.8 If using WEBSERVICES SECURITY (WSS) user authentication, then the
impact/dsa/wsdsa/wss/conf/wscb.properties needs to be altered to
only have one entry. If there is more than one entry in the file,
only the uid.1 and pwd.1 will be read

7.9 Microsoft Internet Explorer 11.
IE11 (supported only with TIP 2.2.0.15) may cause unexpected
behaviour in the Policy Editor, whereby the Policy List panel
disappears when the Project drop-down menu is selected. To
circumvent this, simply click on a different project in the Project
drop-down list and then click again on the desired project, to
restore the correct layout

7.10 With certain Solaris installations the Event Summary portlet
(Administration -> Service Administration -> Services) may fail to
render and cause an Out Of Memory (PermGen) exception (as seen in
the TIP trace log:
"java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space exception")


Solution: 
1. Stop TBSM (kill the hung server if necessary).

2. Goto the $TBSM_HOME/tipv2/profiles/TIPProfile/config/cells/TIPCell/nodes/TIPNode/servers/server1
directory and make a backup of the server.xml file.

3. Open the server.xml file for editing and in the jvmEntries xmi
tag modify the genericJvmArguments attribute to read something
like this, where these two PermSize and MaxPermSize parms are
being added (if other parms are already code, please preserve
those parms and just insert the two new ones): 

genericJvmArguments=" -XX:PermSize=256m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -XX:+DisableExplicitGC"

4. Save the file and restart TBSM.


7.11 TIP Portlet blank or does not load after TIP 2.2.0.15 installation
Refer to the following Technote for resolution:

http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21696426 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21696426]

NOTE: The above issue is resolved also in TIP 2.2.0.15 (version 2)

7.12 TIP chart portlet blank if TBSM Service Admin page is closed and 
re-opened
Refer to the following Technote for resolution:

http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21696424 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21696424]

NOTE: The above issue is resolved also in TIP 2.2.0.15 (version 2)

7.13 TBSM integration with ISM is no longer operational and will be
removed from the next TBSM version 6.1.1 Fix Pack. 
This modification is due to changes in the supported versions of
ITCAM for Transaction / ISM.

7.14 Java Security Warnings
With the ever changing security improvements to both the browsers
Java Runtime Environment (JRE), clients are now more likely to see
warning messages about untrusted connections or invalid
certificates. To avoid those issues, clients can replace the IBM
HTTP Server SSL certificate with an SSL certificate signed by a
third-party CA. For guidance on that task, refer to the following
Technote:

PREREQUISITES
IBM Tivoli Business Service Manager 6.1.1

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

3.7 Installation
------------


3.7.1 Installing the Fix Pack
-----------------------

[Fix Pack] Refers to the directory where you extracted the Fix
Pack files from the zip/tar file.

Attention: Install the Fix Pack with the same user that was
used to install TBSM 6.1.1 GA


NOTE: If you have deployed the Service Level Objectives (SLO) 
Reporting Function, you must do the following before
installing the Fix Pack:

- Stop all Impact services that are running policies that
call the SLO functions to record data in the SLORPRT
database. If you have the service set to start at
server startup, then turn this option off before
installing the fixpack, as the server is restarted
during the fixpack install.

Running the install without DE backup:

If you prefer to backup DE with your own procedures you can
run the install with the following parameter.

-DNO_BACKUP=true

(for Silent Install, uncomment the "NO_BACKUP=true" 
parm on the setupFP.rsp response file)

If you choose this method, you must backup DE before you install.
And restore the original system using your backup/restore
procedures or utilities (if uninstalling the Fix Pack).

Follow this procedure to install the Fix Pack:

1. On the Tivoli Business Service Manager server host, change to the
[Fix Pack]/TBSM directory where you extracted the files.
2. Run the installation using one the following commands:
* setup-windows.exe - Windows.
* setup-<unixplatform>.bin - other operating systems.

Installation command options:

GUI mode No options, for example: 
Windows: setup-windows.exe

or

UNIX® : ./setup-<unixplatform>.bin 

Console mode
Use the -i console option. 
For example -
Windows: setup-windows.exe -i console

or 

UNIX® : ./setup-<unixplatform>.bin -i console

Silent Mode

a. Copy setupFP.rsp from the TBSM directory of the extracted
Fix Pack file ([Fix Pack]/TBSM) to a location it can be
edited (/tmp).
b. Update the file to match your environment.
c. Confirm acceptance of license, by un-commenting this line
and setting the parm to "true":
#LICENSE_ACCEPTED=false
d. Run:

Windows: setup-windows.exe -f C:\tmp\setupFP.rsp

or 

UNIX® :setup-<unixplatform>.bin -f /tmp/setupFP.rsp

Note: The response file needs to have a fully qualified
path.

3. During the install you will be asked to to verify
path names to the TIP install.

4. Restart both the Data and Dashboard processes/services

5. After install is complete (and with the data server started), run
the script ApplyPoliciesFor611FP3, which can be found on the Data
Server under $TBSM_HOME/bin. This script loads the new/updated
policies.

NOTE: Do not run the ApplyPoliciesFor611FP3 on the secondary/
backup data server of a failover pair. This only needs to
be run on the primary data server.

On Windows:

ApplyPoliciesFor611FP3.bat <adminuser> <adminpassword>
For example - ApplyPoliciesFor611FP3.bat tipadmin tipadmin

On Linux/Unix:

./ApplyPoliciesFor611FP3 <adminuser> <adminpassword>
For example - ./ApplyPoliciesFor611FP3 tipadmin tipadmin 

NOTE: Verify that the admin user id and password are
correct otherwise, the script will fail at the last step.

If incorrect, rerun the script with a valid adminuser id
and password.

6. From the TBSM 6.1.1 Fix Pack 3 install media, copy these files
onto the DB2 server (where the tbsmdb was initially installed,
when TBSM was first setup).

from: [Fix Pack]/TBSM/TBSMDBChecker
to: [InstallDirectory]/tbsmdb/bin

TBSM_Check_DB.bat
TBSM_Check_DB.sh
tbsmDatabaseChecker.xml
TBSMDBChecker.props

NOTE: The above action is only needed if you ever plan to use
the TBSM_Check_DB script, which will now suppress the
display of the requested user password.

7. After installing this Fix Pack, end-users may need to clear their
browser cache, close and re-open the browser; in order to avoid
any issues on the client side.

8. If the Impact "Service Level Objectives (SLO) Reporting"
function was enabled, please refer to section 3.12 for additional
post Fix Pack installation required actions.

9. Please refer to section 4.0 "Additional information for TBSM Fix Pack 3 APARS"
for additional post install actions.


3.7.2 Discovery Library Toolkit
-------------------------

1. Navigate to the DiscoveryLibrary directory.

2. To install Fixpack 3, 

If you are on a Windows operating system, run the following
command from a prompt: 

setup-dltoolkit-6.1.1-FP0003-windows_64.exe

If you are on a Unix operating system, run the following
command from a prompt:

setup-dltoolkit-6.1.1-FP0003-<unixplatform>_64.bin

For console mode, specify "-i console".

Note: If the installer cannot find the TBSM 6.1.1 Discovery 
Library Toolkit, verify that the toolkit is installed and 
that it was installed by the user that the fixpack is being 
installed with. If these are both okay, then set the environment
variable TBSM_TOOLKIT_BASE to the location of the toolkit and 
restart the toolkit installer. For example: 
Windows:
set TBSM_TOOLKIT_BASE=C:\Program Files\IBM\tivoli\tbsm\XMLtoolkit
UNIX:
export TBSM_TOOLKIT_BASE=/opt/IBM/tivoli/tbsm/XMLtoolkit

3. The toolkit installer requires access to the database.


4. Notes and Post-Install Considerations:

a) After installation is complete, you may remove
[fixpack] to save space.

5. Restart the toolkit.


3.8 TBSM agent
----------

Installing the TBSM agent (last updated with TBSM Fix Pack 1):

The following packages are available for download in the TBSMAgent
directory on the support download site:

* AIX: KR9_aix526CD-6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0001.tar.gz -AIX (64 bit) 

* Linux: KR9_lx8266CD-6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0001.tar.gz -Li x86_64R2.6(64 bit)

* Solaris: KR9_sol286CD-6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0001.tar.gz -Solaris R8(64 bit)

* Windows: KR9_wix64CD-6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0001.zip -(64 bit)

* zLinux: KR9_ls3266CD-6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0001.tar.gz -Li S390R2.6(64 bit)


To install the updated TBSM agent (FP1), if not already installed:
1. Download the appropriate agent code for your platform.
2. Untar or unzip the file.
3. Install the agent according to the directions in the TBSM
Installation Guide. This is a complete install package for the TBSM
agent support and can be used for a fresh install of the agent.

For instructions on installing and configuring the TBSM agent, see:

http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc/installguide/bsni_agent_ic_install_config.html [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc/installguide/bsni_agent_ic_install_config.html]


3.9 Uninstalling the Fix Pack
-------------------------

Before uninstalling the FixPack all TBSM processes should be
STOPPED. The user must manually stop the TBSM processes, before 
the uninstall of the FixPack (except for OMNIbus and DB2).

Attention: Uninstall the Fix Pack with the same user that was used to
install TBSM 6.1.1 GA.

Silent mode and uninstall


If silent mode was used for the install, the uninstall will
default to a silent uninstall and you must supply a response
file or the uninstall will fail.

For silent mode uninstalls, copy the setup_uninstall.rsp file
from the Fix Pack image to the directory:

<installDir>/tbsm/_uninst/TBSM611_FP3

and update the file with the correct information. Then launch
the installer specifying the file. For example:

uninstall(.exe) -f /tmp/setup_uninstall.rsp

Note: The response file needs to have a fully qualified path.

On the Tivoli Business Service Manager server system:

1. Change to the directory: 
<installDir>/tbsm/_uninst/TBSM611_FP3

2. Run the uninstall command:

UNIX: If you are on a Unix operating system, run the following
command from a prompt.

./uninstall


Windows: If you are on a Windows operating system, run the following
command from a prompt.

.\uninstall.exe

For console mode, specify "-i console"

3. After the command has completed, run the following commands to clear
the server cache.

Linux/AIX: <TIP_HOME>/bin/clearClassCache.sh

Solaris: java -Xshare:dump

Windows: <TIP_HOME>\bin\clearClassCache.bat



4. Uninstall eWAS 7.0.0.35

NOTE: On a "Data server only" environment, the TBSM 6.1.1 Fix
Pack 3 un-installer will not remove the upgraded eWAS
7.0.0.35 Fix Pack it installed. If there are plans to, at
a future time, re-install TBSM 6.1.1 Fix Pack 3, it is
necessary to manually un-install eWAS 7.0.0.35. 

These steps DO NOT apply to a "Dashboard sever only"
environment or a "Single server" environment, where both the
Data and Dashboard are installed together.

Again, these steps are only needed on a "Data server only"
environment. Failure to perform these actions, will prevent
the re-install of TBSM 6.1.1 Fix Pack 3!

a). Copy the uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt to a temporary location
The uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt file is located on:
<installdir>/tbsm/_uninst/TBSM611_FP3/plan/install/MachinePlan_localhost/00002_WASFP/uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt

For example on Unix:
/opt/IBM/tivoli/tbsm/_uninst/TBSM611_FP3/plan/install/MachinePlan_localhost/00002_IAGLOBAL_COI_STEP_WASFP/uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt

For example on Windows:
C:\IBM\tivoli\tbsm\_uninst\TBSM611_FP3\plan\install\MachinePlan_localhost\00002_IAGLOBAL_COI_STEP_WASFP\uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt


Or from the TBSM 6.1.1 FP3 install media:
6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0003-<ARCH>\TBSM\COI\PackageSteps\WASFP\uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt


b). Edit the uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt (on the temporary location)

c). locate this line: -W product.location="@IAGLOBAL_WAS_HOME@"

d). Replace above line with: -W product.location="<installdir>/tipv2"

Where <installdir> is the fully qualified directory where tipv2 located:

for example (Unix): -W product.location="/opt/IBM/tivoli/tipv2"

for example (Windows): -W product.location="C:\IBM\tivoli\tipv2"

e). Save the uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt file (on the temporary location)

f). Execute the following command:
On Unix:
<installdir>/tipv2/WebSphereUpdateInstallerV7/update.sh -options <templocation>/uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt -silent

for example: /opt/IBM/tivoli_root/tipv2/WebSphereUpdateInstallerV7/update.sh -options /tmp/uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt -silent

On Windows:
<installdir>/tipv2/WebSphereUpdateInstallerV7/update.exe -options <templocation>/uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt -silent

for exampe: C:\IBM\tivoli\tipv2\WebSphereUpdateInstallerV7\update.exe -options C:\Temp\uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt -silent

5. Restart the Data Server and Dashboard Server.



Discovery Library Toolkit
===================================================

The Toolkit portion of this fixpack cannot be uninstalled.

 IBM Important Information about the WebSphere MQ Configuration Agent, Withdrawn from IBM OMEGAMON for Messaging on z/OS V7.5 - United States  PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION

ABSTRACT
 Starting with V7.5, IBM OMEGAMON for Messaging on z/OS no longer delivers the component called WebSphere MQ Configuration Agent, referred to as MQ Configuration in the rest of this document, because there are other recommended ways to configure IBM MQ. It is stabilized in the previous V7.3 release, but MQ Configuration will be supported as long as V7.3 is in support. The components in V7.5 are the IBM MQ Monitoring Agent and the IBM Integration Bus Monitoring Agent, both of which have enhancements in V7.5 that address monitoring requirements you may have. You can upgrade your OMEGAMON for Messaging monitoring components to V7.5 while using the previous release of MQ Configuration. 

Whether or not you want to continue using MQ Configuration when you install and configure OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5, there may be steps you need to take, so please review this document prior to installing and configuring V7.5. 

CONTENT
First, please determine whether you have previously installed and configured the MQ Configuration component. If you have not done so previously, there is no need for you to consider the rest of this document. For this determination, please examine the following: 


· SMP/E: Are the FMIDs for MQ Configuration installed? The FMIDs are HKMC730 and HKCF730, or HKMC710 and HKCF710 if you are using the V7.1 level. 
· PARMGEN: In your PARMGEN configuration for each runtime environment, does the “Include Products in this PARMGEN RTE panel (KCIP@PGI)” (under step “1 KCIJPCFG Set-up/Refresh PARMGEN work environment” navigation from the PARAMETER GENERATOR (PARMGEN) WORKFLOW - PRIMARY OPTION MENU), have the line for “KMC OMEGAMON for Messaging – WebSphere MQ Configuration” selected for configuration in the environment? 

If the answers are “yes” to both of the above questions, then you do need to continue with the following general steps, which are documented in detail below: 

1) Determine whether there are any users of MQ Configuration in your environment. There are many cases in which the MQ Configuration component is installed and configured in PARMGEN, but no one is actually using it. It is important to determine this in order to decide which step to take next.

2) If you do not have users of MQ Configuration, or you want to remove it anyway, there may be steps required when you are installing and configuring OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5 especially if you previously configured a shared agent address space for MQ monitoring (KMQ) and MQ configuration (KMC) agents. 

3) If you do have users of MQ Configuration and want to continue supporting that usage, you need to follow recommendations when you are installing and configuring OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5 upgraded products.


Here are the details:

1) Suggested ways to determine whether there are any users of MQ Configuration:

a. In the Tivoli Enterprise Portal (TEP), using an administrator user ID, click Edit->Administer Users to check whether any users or groups have access to the Configuration navigator view. For users and/or groups that have been configured for TEP, check the Navigator Views tab to see if any of them have “Configuration” in their Assigned Views. If no one is allowed access to the Configuration navigator, then they are not using MQ Configuration feature. 

b. Another item to check in Administer Users is whether any user or group has the Permissions tab showing that View or Modify permission has been authorized for WebSphere MQ Configuration Authorities “Configure” authority. Some user or group should have permission to use this feature if it is used by anyone. 

c. Check whether there are configured names that reflect queue managers in your environment. Click on the Configuration navigator in the view drop-down list in the Navigator pane, then click on Defined View on the left. In the middle Defined Tree pane on the workspace, expand the various “+” items, and with the help of someone who knows MQ queue managers in your environment, see if any of the expanded items reflect queue managers actually in your environment. There will be default and example items shipped with the product, but you are looking for names reflecting MQ at your site. If there are no names that reflect queue managers in your environment, then no one is using MQ Configuration.

d. If it appears that there is usage of MQ Configuration, it would still be good to check with MQ users at your site to see if they actually require it. Perhaps they have experimented with it but do not actually use it regularly. If the OMEGAMON feature for MQ Configuration is not absolutely required in your environment, the recommendation would be to review all the ways that the IBM MQ product offers to configure and administer MQ, some of which are new in recent releases. Also, remember that the OMEGAMON MQ Monitoring agent offers the Take Action facility to issue any MQSC configuration command if the user is authorized.


2) If there are no users of MQ Configuration, or you want to remove it anyway: 

a. If you use a Serverpac that contains the upgraded OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5 components to install, the MQ Configuration FMIDs (HKMC730 and HKCF730) are not installed because they are not included in the Serverpac. However, depending on your previous configuration, the missing MQ Configuration component could cause unexpected results in your LPAR runtime environment (RTE), so check and act on the following items prior to installation and configuration of OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5:

1. If your Hub TEMS is configured on the z/OS platform and there are RKCF* DDNAME statements in your existing Hub TEMS started task JCL, update the TEMS started task JCL to remove those RKCF* DDNAME statements.

2. If MQ Configuration (KMC) and MQ Monitoring (KMQ) agents are running in a shared agent address space, make sure that the owner of that address space is the MQ Monitoring agent. For the MQ Monitoring agent to be the owner, the related PARMGEN LPAR RTE profile parameters for OMEGAMON for Messaging components may need adjusting, as depicted in the following example before and after settings:

Before (MQ Configuration owns the Agent address space called OMEGMQ):
ISREDDE2 %RTE_PLIB_HILEV%.%RTE_NAME%.WCONFIG(%RTE_NAME%) 
Command ===> 
KMC_AGT_STC OMEGMQ
KMC_AGT_STC_OWNER “”
KMQ_AGT_STC “”
KMQ_AGT_STC_OWNER OMEGMQ

After (MQ Monitoring owns the Agent address space called OMEGMQ): 
ISREDDE2 %RTE_PLIB_HILEV%.%RTE_NAME%.WCONFIG(%RTE_NAME%) 
Command ===>
KMQ_AGT_STC OMEGMQ
KMQ_AGT_STC_OWNER “” 

Tip: Please review the SMPE06 upgrade scenario [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAUBV/com.ibm.omegamon_share.doc_6.3.0.2/parmgenref/smpe06_parmgenref.htm?pos=2] in the OMEGAMON Shared Knowledge Center as part of deploying these changes. You can use the refreshed OMEGMQ OMEGAMON for Messaging – KMQ Agent-only address space in the RTE’s W/RKANSAMU dataset for refreshing the original shared address space in your system procedure library. The only delta would be the RKMCAPLA DDNAME, which can be staged for removal.

b. If you install OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5 as a CBPDO into an existing SMP/E CSI, the MQ Configuration FMIDs will remain installed, but since you are not using MQ Configuration, it is recommended you follow these steps:

1. If MQ Configuration (KMC) and MQ Monitoring (KMQ) agents are running in a shared agent address space, make sure that the owner of that address space is the MQ Monitoring agent. See item a.2 above for more details.

2. In the “Include Products in this PARMGEN RTE panel (KCIP@PGI)” (under step “1 KCIJPCFG Set-up/Refresh PARMGEN work environment” navigation from the PARAMETER GENERATOR (PARMGEN) WORKFLOW - PRIMARY OPTION MENU), deselect the line with “KMC OMEGAMON for Messaging – WebSphere MQ Configuration” so that it will be removed from the runtime environment (RTE) during reconfiguration/upgrade of the RTE. Follow one of the SMPEnn upgrade scenarios [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAUBV/com.ibm.omegamon_share.doc_6.3.0.2/parmgenref/smpe04_parmgenref.htm?pos=2] documented in the OMEGAMON Shared Knowledge Center. 

Tip: Prior to upgrading the RTE, you also have the option to SMP/E delete the HKMC730 and HKCF730 FMIDs from the existing CSI. When you start the PARMGEN configuration phase of the upgrade, the inexistence of these deleted FMIDs is PARMGEN’s trigger to delete the product from the RTE upon reconfiguration following any of the SMPEnn upgrade scenarios (SMPE04 [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAUBV/com.ibm.omegamon_share.doc_6.3.0.2/parmgenref/smpe04_parmgenref.htm?pos=2], SMPE05 [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAUBV/com.ibm.omegamon_share.doc_6.3.0.2/parmgenref/smpe05_parmgenref.htm?pos=2] or SMPE06 [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAUBV/com.ibm.omegamon_share.doc_6.3.0.2/parmgenref/smpe06_parmgenref.htm?pos=2]). 


3) If there are users of MQ Configuration, and you want to continue supporting that usage: 

a. It is highly recommended that you install OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5 as a CBPDO into the existing SMP/E CSI so that MQ Configuration remains available. If you do this, there are no other steps required, however, the following step is also highly recommended: 

1. If MQ Configuration (KMC) and MQ Monitoring (KMQ) agents are running in a shared agent address space, separate them into their own address spaces, since they will be running at different product levels. For this, the related PARMGEN LPAR RTE profile parameters for OMEGAMON for Messaging components may need adjusting to be like the following example in which MQ Configuration is running in an address space called OMEGMC and MQ Monitoring is running in an address space called OMEGMQ:

ISREDDE2 %RTE_PLIB_HILEV%.%RTE_NAME%.WCONFIG(%RTE_NAME%) 
Command ===> 
KMC_AGT_STC OMEGMC
KMC_AGT_STC_OWNER “”
KMQ_AGT_STC OMEGMQ
KMQ_AGT_STC_OWNER “”

b. If you were to install OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5 in a Serverpac, you would need to retain your old SMP/E CSI and maintain a separate PARMGEN runtime environment in order to use MQ Configuration separately. This may be acceptable to you if you already separate MQ Configuration from the rest of your monitoring infrastructure, with its own Hub TEMS, etc. In this case, for the configuration that will contain OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5, please see item 2 above, steps a.1 and a.2 in case they would apply to that particular configuration.

c. OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5 application support does not include application support for the MQ Configuration component. If you need to re-install application support for MQ Configuration for any reason, you should use the latest V7.3 level of application support. For z/OS customers, that is available with DVD LCD7-3513-08 at the following link: ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/tivoli_support/misc/PandA/tools_agent/tools/appsupt/ [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/tivoli_support/misc/PandA/tools_agent/tools/appsupt/]

 IBM SCA destinations for IBM Business Process Manager (BPM), WebSphere Process Server (WPS) and WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus (WESB) are not preserved when uninstalling and reinstalling a service module - United States SCA.RecycleDestinations; custom properties; SCA destinations; event sequencing; SCA modules; message queue TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When a Service Component Architecture (SCA) module is uninstalled, by default, its associated destinations are removed, even if there are still messages in the destination queue. In some situations, such as when Event Sequencing is used, messages on the destinations must be preserved.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this issue, use the SCA.recycleDestinations custom Java™ virtual machine (JVM) property for the module. Set the property to false to preserve SCA destinations.

 IBM HTTP Session time-out settings and overwrite precedence rules - United States WebSphere http session management time-out wasrun precedence overwrite TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 It is possible to set the HTTP Session time-out in various places on the IBM® WebSphere® Application Server Administrative Console. It is also possible to set HTTP Session time-out for the application packaging process. 

Since Session time-out can be set in multiple places, it is necessary to understand how the ultimate Session time-out for an application is determined. 

CAUSE
Application needs HTTP session time-out set.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The HTTP Session time-out can be set in the following places: 

 * From the Administrative Console at the server, Enterprise application, and Web application levels 
 * At the time when the application is packaged 
 * In the application code


Setting the HTTP Session time-out from the Administrative Console 
1. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the server level, navigate to Servers > Application Servers > Your Server > Web Container > Session Management. 

In the Session time-out section of this window, you can select No time-out or Set time-out by clicking the appropriate radio button. If you choose to set the time-out, type the desired value in minutes in the box. 


2. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the Enterprise Application level, navigate to Applications > Enterprise Applications > Your Application > Session Management. 

Check Override in the Override Session Management section, then select to set the time-out and the time-out value. This sets the application session to overwrite those values set at the parent, which in this case is the Server level. 


3. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the Web Application level, navigate to Applications > Enterprise Applications > Your Application > Web Module > Your Web App.war > Session Management. 

Check Override in the Override Session Management section, then select to set the time-out and the time-out value. This sets the Application Session to overwrite those values set at the parent levels, which in this case is the Server or Enterprise Application level. 

After modifying these settings, save the master configuration. 

Setting HTTP Session time-out when application is packaged 

The application developer can also select to set the HTTP Session time-out parameter when the application is packaged. This value is stored in the web.xml file for the Web application. 

This setting overrides any session time-outs defined from the Administrative Console. Alter this setting by repackaging the application with a new value, or by modifying the web.xml file. The entry in the web.xml will be as follows: 
          <session-config> 
      *          <session-timeout>60</session-timeout>
 * 
 *       </session-config>

 

Where the "session-timeout" is an integer value for the desired session time-out in minutes. 
Setting HTTP Session time-out from the application code 

Finally, the HTTP Session time-out can be set in the application code. The programmer can invoke the setMaxInactiveInterval() method on HttpSession object to set the time-out value as desired. This setting overrides any time-out defined in the application package or made from the Administrative Console. 

HTTP Session time-out Override Precedence Summary 

The list below shows the precedence from which the final HTTP Session time-out is derived. 

1. Server Level [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21163875&amp;aid=1] Lowest level 2. Enterprise Application [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21163875&amp;aid=1] Overrides the Server Level if Override is selected 3.

 IBM Installing the Installation Manager on an NFS mounted disk - United States NFS; remote drive; mount drive ; 1308281 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Can IBM® Installation Manager be installed on a UNIX® or Linux® NFS mounted disk? 

ANSWER
Do not install the IBM Installation Manager on an NFS mounted disk. 

On AIX® for example, some of the JRE folders are not being deleted when the IBM Installation Manager uninstalls but is deleted after waiting for 10 minutes. This causes the JRE folder to not be uninstalled during an uninstall operation. Other UNIX and Linux operating systems have similar issues. 

Only install the Installation Manager on a local disk. 

 IBM How to find details of Corrupted Object from the entries in db2diag.log? - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How to find details of Corrupted Object from the entries in db2diag.log? 

ANSWER
When we have corruption in the database we may received following kind of entries in db2diag.log 
These also notify object where we t where we have detected corruption in the Database.

Sample db2diag.log entry for Corruption.

2016-05-04-03.13.05.261082-360 I3442A358 LEVEL: Error 
PID : 393470 TID : 1 PROC : db2pfchr 0

PID : 393470 TID : 1 PROC : db2pfchr 0 
INSTANCE: db2inst1 NODE : 000 
FUNCTION: DB2 UDB, buffer pool services, sqlbReadAndReleaseBuffers, 
probe:13 
DATA #1 : String, 158 bytes 
Obj={pool:3;obj:21;type:0} State=x27 Parent={3;21}, EM=1120, PP0=1152 
Page=51235 Cont=17 Offset=2848 BlkSize=15 
sqlbReadAndReleaseBuffers error: num-pages=16


Based on this information dumped in db2diag.log entry we can Identify {pool:3;obj:21;type:0} is the Object is corrupted.

e.g. Obj={pool:3;obj:21;type:0}

Pool = Tablespace ID
Obj = Object ID
Type = Type of the Object

If Type is 0 its Table Object ,If its 1 then its Index. 

We can find the Name of the Object using following query, to further backup the Definition for future reference.

db2 "select char(tabname,20), char(tabschema,20) from syscat.tables where tableid=<ObjectID> and tbspaceid=<Tablepace id>"

Obj={pool:3;obj:21;type:0}
db2 "select char(tabname,20), char(tabschema,20) from syscat.tables where tableid=21 and tbspaceid=3"

 IBM JMSExceptions CWSIT0006E and CWSIA0241E on bus connect - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Your application throws JMS exceptions CWSIT0006E and CWSIA0241E when trying to connect to a WebSphere Application Server (WAS) Service Integration Bus (SIBus). 

SYMPTOM
Application throws the following JMS exceptions in the stack trace while trying to connect to the SIBus: 

JMSException caught
javax.jms.JMSException: CWSIA0241E: An exception was received during the call to the method
JmsManagedConnectionFactoryImpl.createConnection:
com.ibm.websphere.sib.exception.SIResourceException: CWSIT0006E: It is not possible to contact
a messaging engine in bus YOURBUS..
at
com.ibm.ws.sib.api.jms.impl.JmsManagedConnectionFactoryImpl.createConnection(JmsManagedConnectionFactoryImpl.java:225)
at
com.ibm.ws.sib.api.jms.impl.JmsManagedConnectionFactoryImpl.createConnection(JmsManagedConnectionFactoryImpl.java:148)


CAUSE
This can be caused by a stopped messaging engine, a wrong or misspelled bus name (case-sensitive) in the connection factory settings or, the HA manager is not able to find the running messaging engine.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The error messages CWSIA0241E and CWSIT0006E indicate that when the connection was attempted, there were no running messaging engines available on the specified bus. To see why the messaging engines were not available, check the SystemOut.log for applicable messages. Examine the SystemOut.log file starting at the time period when the application experienced the problem and search backward. 


Check for the CWSID0016I which indicates status of the Messaging Engine activity. You may see messages like this:

SibMessage I [:] CWSID0016I: Messaging engine [mename]is in state Stopping.
SibMessage I [:] CWSID0016I: Messaging engine [mename]is in state Stopped.

The solution for this problem is to start the messaging engine.

If the messaging engine is running and you still see these errors at the application side, other possible reasons for this problem are:

1) Check provider end points. The value for the provider endpoints should be in the format of host_name:port_number:BootstrapBasicMessaging.

In the JMS connection factory, you can define a list of provider endpoints that govern which servers the application will attempt to connect to. If you have defined these endpoints, ensure that the messaging engines for these servers have all started and that the port and transport chains defined in the endpoint list are correct. Also, ensure that the values for the Connection proximity (bus, cluster, host or server) and the Target groups and Target significance settings are appropriate. For example, if the Target significance value is Required and no suitable messaging engine could be located, then this would cause a connection failure. Please refer to the following links for how to set provider endpoints:

Default messaging provider queue connection factory [Settings] : [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/ae/SIBJMSQueueConnectionFactory_DetailForm.html]

Default messaging provider topic connection factory [Settings]: [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/ae/SIBJMSTopicConnectionFactory_DetailForm.html]

Restart the server after making the change.

2) If your environment is heavily loaded, the HA manager might not be able to locate the running messaging engine within three seconds. In this case, check if there are any hung threads in the SystemOut.log, and resolve them if possible. Next, consider increasing the value of sib.trm.linger from three to give the HA manager more time to locate a messaging engine.

Tune the sib.trm.linger property value in the sib.properties file to set the messaging engine lookup delay so that the Work Load Manager (WLM) waits for a longer period of time before returning an error. Please refer to information below on how to set this property in the sib.properties. 

1)<WAS_HOME>/properties : The properties declared under this location would be applicable to all the profiles in that installation.

2)<PROFILE_ROOT>/properties : The properties declared here are applicable for all the servers on this profile

If a property is defined at both <PROFILE_ROOT>/properties and <WAS_HOME>/properties, then the property defined at <PROFILE_ROOT>/properties would take precedence.

After resetting the property you must restart the server.

==========================

CAUSE
This exception can happen during ejbdeploy after the WebSphere Application Server has been upgraded, and old OSGI cache remains for the ejbdeploy tool. The OSGI class of the ejbdeploy tool contains class information within the deploytool folder and can become stale if the content inside deploytool has changed. 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the problem, complete the following steps: 


1. Delete/Remove the contents of the following directory EXCEPT for the 'config.ini' file, if it exists (the paths are different depending on your backend WAS version):

WebSphere Application Server v6.1.x: 
<profile root>/deploytools/configuration

WebSphere Application Server v7.0.x: 
<profile root>/ejbdeploy/configuration
<AppServer root>/deploytool/itp/configuration


WebSphere Application Server v8.0.x:
<profile root>/ejbdeploy/configuration
<AppServer root>/deploytool/itp/configuration


Cluster Environments: Do this for both the DMGR profile and the node profile.

Note: The deploytools and ejbdeploy directories may not exist on all nodes. They are created when ejbdeploy is executed successfully for the first time. If it has never been executed successfully in your environment, then the directories will not be there.

2. Re-attempt the WebSphere Portal upgrade.

 IBM The affect of the auto-update feature for Oracle JDK 7 on IBM Mobile Foundation, IBM Worklight, IBM Worklight Foundation, and IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation - United States  NEWS

ABSTRACT
 The IBM Mobile Foundation, IBM Worklight, IBM Worklight Foundation, and IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation products support Oracle JDK 7, but do not support Oracle JDK 8. 

CONTENT
On Windows operating systems, because the upgrade to Oracle JDK 8 is enabled by default, you might not be aware that the upgrade has occurred. This Oracle JDK 8 issue applies to the Mac OS as well.



SYMPTOM
You might see one of the following messages in the log file on Windows and Mac OS machines that originate from the WebSphere Application Server Liberty Profile: 

 * TRAS0033E: Runtime injection of detailed method trace failed for class <class name> with exception <exception name> 
 * CWWKC0044W: An exception occurred while scanning class and annotation data. 


RESOLUTION
As stated on the Java SE at a Glance [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html] page, Oracle is automatically migrating users with the auto-update feature enabled from Oracle JDK 7 to Oracle JDK 8. However, a number of IBM and third-party dependencies for IBM Mobile Foundation, IBM Worklight, IBM Worklight Foundation, and IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation do not support Oracle JDK 8.




 * Windows operating systems
   If you have already migrated to Oracle JDK 8, you need to revert to Oracle JDK 7 using the following steps:  1. Uninstall Oracle JDK 8.
       
       
    2. Download the latest version of Oracle JDK 7 from the Java SE Downloads [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html] tab of the Oracle web site.
       
       
    3. Reinstall Oracle JDK 7.
       
       
   
   To disable the JDK auto-update feature on Windows operating systems, see the Change Automatic Update Settings [http://java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml#adv] section of the Oracle Java Auto Update documentation.
   
   
 * Mac OS
   If you have already migrated to Oracle JDK 8, you need to revert to Oracle JDK 7 using the following steps:  1. Uninstall Oracle JDK 8. For more information, see the How do I uninstall Java 7 and later versions on my Mac? [https://www.java.com/en/download/help/mac_uninstall_java.xml] information on the Oracle web site.
       
       
    2. Download the latest version of Oracle JDK 7 from the Java SE Downloads [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html] tab of the Oracle web site. For more information, see JDK 7 Installation for Mac OS X [http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/mac/mac-jdk.html].
       
       
    3. Reinstall Oracle JDK 7. 
       
       
   
   
   On the Mac OS operating system, you are explicitly asked if you want to update your Java version. Do not update the Java version to Java 8. To verify your Java version, see How do I update Java for my Mac? [https://www.java.com/en/download/help/mac_java_update.xml]

Steps for installing Combined Cumulative Fix 

BEFORE YOU BEGIN:
Familiarize yourself with the Portal Upgrade Best Practices available from IBM Remote Technical Support for WebSphere Portal.

Portal Upgrades: Best Practices for V7.0 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21452611] For instructions on how to validate your environment prior to the upgrade, see the instructions for running the Health Checker tool for WebSphere Portal at:

Health Checker tool for WebSphere Portal V7.0 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27020200] IMPORTANT: Certain security configurations can cause failures with the upgrade. Please check the following technote to see if this may apply to your environment.

Fix Pack 7.0.0.1 fails at action-import-defaultnodes-wp.filestore/base task. [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21496067] 
 1. Perform the following steps before installing Combined Cumulative fix:
     1. Before you install this combined cumulative fix, check to see if the list of fixes already installed on your system is included in the list of fixes provided in this combined cumulative fix. If you have temporary, interim or cumulative fixes on your system that are not included in this Combined Cumulative Fix, then uninstall those fixes before installing this Combined Cumulative Fix and contact IBM Support for an updated version of that fix, or for more information. 
     2. If you are running an external Web server such as IBM HTTP server, stop the Web server. 
     3. Verify that the information in the wkplc.properties, wkplc_dbdomain.properties, wkplc_dbtype.properties, and wkplc_comp.properties files are correct. WebSphere Portal 7 introduced support for multiple profiles. If using multiple profiles, also verify that the information in each profile is correct. See the following link for multiple profiles Supporting multiple profiles: wp7 [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/Supporting_multiple_profiles_wp7].  * Enter a value for the PortalAdminPwd and WasPassword parameters in the wkplc.properties file. 
         * Ensure that the DbUser (database user) and DbPassword (database password) parameters are defined correctly for all database domains in the wkplc_dbdomain.properties file. 
         * Unix/Linux/Windows/IBM i Only: The WebSphere Portal Update Installer removes plain text passwords from the wkplc*.properties files. To keep these passwords in the properties files, include the following line in the wkplc.properties file: PWordDelete=false. 
         * Ensure that the value of the XmlAccessPort property in wkplc_comp.properties matches the value of the port used for HTTP connections to the WebSphere Portal server. 
        
        
     4. Special considerations for multiple profiles or binary install or migration upgrade:  1. If you did a binary installation and created a WebSphere Portal profile later, or your Portal 7.0.0.x was migrated from 6.1.x, ensure that the PortalServer/wps.properties file correctly references the profile. The Portal Update Installer uses the wps.properties file to determine which profile is the primary profile to update. Failure to complete this step could result in an inoperable Portal server after the Combined Cumulative Fix installation completes.  1. Edit the <PortalServer root>/wps.properties file in a text editor 
             2. Add these two properties if they do not already exist:
                ProfileName=<your profile name, e.g. wp_profile>
                ProfileDirectory=<your profile directory, e.g. /opt/IBM/WebSphere/wp_profile>
                
                Note: The ProfileDirectory property should use forward slash (/) instead of backslash (\) on Windows.
            
            
         2. If you have created multiple profiles. the Portal Update Installer will automatically upgrade all profiles. If you want to specify which profiles are updated, then complete the following steps:  1. Edit the <PortalServer root>/wps.properties file in a text editor 
             2. Add this property if it does not already exist:
                AutoUpdateMultipleProfiles=<comma separated list of profile names, e.g. wp_profile, wp_profile2, wp_profile3>
            
            
         3. If using Multiple Profiles, verify all your profiles are at the same level before starting upgrade.
            
        
        
     5. Perform the following steps to download the Combined Cumulative Fix and the WebSphere Portal Update Installer:  1. Download the latest Combined Cumulative fix (e.g. 7.0.0.2-WP-WCM-Combined-CFPMnnnnn-CFnnn), and the latest WebSphere Portal Update Installer from http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24027857 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24027857]. 
         2. Create the PortalServer_root/update directory and extract the WebSphere Portal Update Installer file into this directory. 
         3. Create the PortalServer_root/update/fixes directory and extract the 7.0.0.2-WP-WCM-Combined-CFPMnnnnn-CFnnn.zip file into this directory, where n is the numbers associated with the version of the Combined Cumulative fix. Note for z/OS users: refer to Installing interim fixes on WebSphere Portal Enable for z/OS using Portal Update Installer [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21326670] for detailed descriptions of how to execute steps ii. and iii. above. 
            
        
        
    
    


2. Choose either the graphical user interface installation option or the command line installation option: 

NOTE: Not all platforms can use the graphical user interface (IBM i and z/OS can only use command line). 

NOTE: If the installation fails, use the IBM Support Assistant [http://www.ibm.com/software/support/isa/] to access support-related information and serviceability tools for problem determination. For IBM i, download ISA on a system other than IBM i. On the Support Assistant Welcome page, click Service. Then click the Create Portable Collector link to create a remotely collect the data from your IBM i system. Fix what is causing the problem and then rerun the installation task. 


If using the Universal PUI, (which does not include the bundled Java environment), run the following command, setupCmdLine.bat for Windows or . ./setupCmdLine.sh for Unix/Linux from the was_profile_root/bin directory to set up the Java environment for the graphical user interface installation program. When updating a Portal that does not have a profile because it was installed with isBinaryInstall="true", then run setupCmdLine.bat|.sh from PortalServer_root/bin. z/OS users can not use the Universal PUI. 

Enter the following command to launch the graphical user interface installation program:  *  Windows: PortalServer_root\update> updatePortalWizard.bat Unix/Linux: PortalServer_root/update> ./updatePortalWizard.sh
   
   - OR -
   Perform the following steps to launch the installation program from the command line:  1. Stop any active application servers using the stopServer command. To see which application servers are active use the serverStatus command. 
    2. Enter the following command to launch the installation program (NOTE: Enter the command on one line):
   
    * Windows: PortalServer_root\update> updatePortal.bat -install
      -installDir "<PortalServer_root>"
      -fix
      -fixDir "<PortalServer_root>\update\fixes"
      -fixes < Cumulative fix > 
    * Unix/Linux: PortalServer_root/update> ./updatePortal.sh -install
      -installDir "<PortalServer_root>"
      -fix
      -fixDir "<PortalServer_root>/update/fixes"
      -fixes < Cumulative fix > 
    * IBM i: portal_server_root/update> updatePortal.sh -install
      -installDir "<portal_server_root>"
      -fix
      -fixDir "<portal_server_root>/update/fixes"
      -fixes < Cumulative fix > 
    * z/OS: If the Health Checker Tool for WebSphere Portal V7.0 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27020200] has not been run then it needs to be run before installing the Combined Cumulative Fix. Execute the following commands to install the Combined Cumulative Fix:  1. From <was_profile_root>/bin directory:
          . ./setupCmdLine.sh 
       2. PortalServer_root/update> ./updatePortal.sh -install
          -installDir "<PortalServer_root>"
          -fix
          -fixDir "<PortalServer_root>/update/fixes"
          -fixes <Cumulative fix>
          
          Alternatively, the steps i. and ii. above can be executed via JCL. Customize the JCL samples from the following link: Installing interim fixes on WebSphere Portal Enable for z/OS using Portal Update Installer [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21326670]. Submit the JCLs, and then return here to continue.
          
      
      
   
   If you do not have any profiles at this point (because you are in the process of migration from WebSphere Portal 6.1 or Installing an additional node for a cluster or creating multiple profiles) no post installation steps are necessary and you can continue with the next steps that create the profiles as outlined by the according documentation.
   
   z/OS: If doing an upgrade as part of a migration from a previous version (eg. 6.x), run ./ConfigEngine.sh gather-migration-files command from the <wp_profile_root>/ConfigEngine directory.
   
   z/OS: Run the following command: <wp_profile_root>/PortalServer/bin/UpdateProfile.sh install CF skipPreCheckProfile
   
   All other platforms: To update a profile after an upgrade, the following command can be used to update profiles that are not included in AutoUpdateMultipleProfiles. All profiles that were not included in AutoUpdateMultipleProfiles need to be updated after the upgrade is done. All profiles must be at the same level for future upgrades to be applied. See the following link for multiple profiles Supporting multiple profiles: wp7 [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/Supporting_multiple_profiles_wp7].
   
   <wp_profile_root>/PortalServer/bin/UpdateProfile.bat|.sh install CF
   
   This cumulative fix provides updates to OSGi bundles. After installing the cumulative fix, run "<profile location>/bin/osgiCfgInit.sh" (for IBM i the command is just osgiCfgInit, for Microsoft Windows the command is osgiCfgInit.bat) to clear the caches and make the OSGi container pick up the updates to the modified OSGi bundles. Note that it is recommended to stop the portal server before running the osgiCfgInit command. 
 *

3. Perform the following post installation steps: 
 *  If you are running an external Web server such as IBM HTTP server and you are using the WebSphere Application Server automatic generation and propagation of the plugin, then just restart the Web server. If you are not using the automatic generation and propagation, then perform the following steps:
    1. Regenerate the Web server plugin. 
    2. Copy the plugin-cfg.xml file to the Plugin directory. 
    3. Restart the Web server.
       
   
   Redeploy your customization, including JSPs, to the WCM portlets if you are using Web Content Manager and you customized the portlets prior to installing the Combined Cumulative fix.  1. To update the deployed remote rendering portlet:  * Backup any files (e.g. custom JSPs) which have been copied to the deployed remote rendering portlet WAR directory 
        * Log in to Portal as the Portal Administrator 
        * Navigate to: Administration / Portlet Management / Web Modules 
        * Find and select the remote rendering portlet web module 
        * Click the Update Portlet Icon to the right of the selected portlet 
        * Select the updated portlet WAR file located in: <PortalServer_root>/PortalServer/wcm/prereq.wcm/installableApps 
        * Click Next and Finish
       
       
    2. To update the deployed PDM Doc List Portlet:  * Backup any files (e.g. custom JSPs) which have been copied to the deployed remote rendering portlet WAR directory 
        * Log in to Portal as the Portal Administrator 
        * Navigate to: Administration / Portlet Management / Web Modules 
        * Find and select the PDM Doc List Portlet web module 
        * Click the Update Portlet Icon to the right of the selected portlet 
        * Select the updated portlet WAR file located in: <PortalServer_root>/PortalServer/wcm/prereq.wcm/installableApps 
        * Click Next and Finish
       
       
    3. Log out of Portal for changes to take effect.
   
   Clear the browser cache before using the updated Web Content Manager. Review the following documentation "Configuration Changes and Options introduced in WP/WCM V7.0.0.1 and 7.0.0.2 Combined Cumulative Fixes" [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27021250] to see if it applies to your environment.

Steps for uninstalling Combined Cumulative Fix 

NOTE: Changing the server context root after upgrading is an unsupported uninstall path. To uninstall after changing the context root, you must first change the server context root back to the values of the previous version. 

NOTE: Configuring Portal Server from a stand-alone environment to a cluster environment after upgrading is an unsupported uninstall path. 

 1. Perform the following steps before you uninstall the Combined Cumulative Fix:  1. If you are running an external Web server such as IBM HTTP server, stop the Web server. 
     2. Verify that the information in the wkplc.properties, wkplc_dbdomain.properties, wkplc_dbtype.properties, and wkplc_comp.properties files are correct. If using multiple profiles, also verify that the information in each profile is correct. See the following link for multiple profiles Supporting multiple profiles: wp7 [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/Supporting_multiple_profiles_wp7].  * Enter a value for the PortalAdminPwd and WasPassword parameters in the wkplc.properties file. 
         * Ensure that the DbUser (database user) and DbPassword (database password) parameters are defined correctly for all database domains in the wkplc_dbdomain.properties file. 
         * If using a database other than the default, grant permissions to databases within the framework by setting the DbUser (database user) and DbPassword (database password) parameters in the wkplc_dbdomain.properties file. 
         * Unix/Linux/Windows/IBM i Only: The WebSphere Portal Update Installer removes plain text passwords from the wkplc*.properties files. To keep these passwords in the properties files, include the following line in the wkplc.properties file: PWordDelete=false. 
         * Ensure that the value of the XmlAccessPort property in wkplc_comp.properties matches the value of the port used for HTTP connections to the WebSphere Portal server. 
         * WebSphere Portal 7 introduced support for multiple profiles. During the Combined Cumulative Fix uninstall the primary profile is downgraded first if one exists (The Update Installer also supports the update case for a binary only install without profiles). The primary profile is identified by two properties, ProfileDirectory and ProfileName. Ensure these properties are set before starting the downgrade process. 
         * If using Multiple Profiles, verify all your profiles are at the same level before starting downgrade.
           
        
        
    
    
 2. Choose either the graphical user interface uninstallation option or the command line uninstallation option:
    
    NOTE: Not all platforms can use the graphical user interface (IBM i and z/OS can only use command line).
    
    NOTE: If the uninstallation fails, use the IBM Support Assistant [http://www.ibm.com/software/support/isa/] to access support-related information and serviceability tools for problem determination. For IBM i, download ISA on a system other than IBM i. On the Support Assistant Welcome page, click Service. Then click the Create Portable Collector link to create a remotely collect the data from your IBM i system. Fix what is causing the problem and then rerun the installation task.

     2. Copy the plugin-cfg.xml file to the Plugin directory. 
     3. Restart the Web server.
    
    
 5. If you previously customized any configuration files in the wp_profile_root/PortalServer/config directory, check to see if uninstalling the cumulative fix affected those files by restoring a version of the files that was saved when the cumulative fix was originally installed. If it did affect the files, you must perform the same customization on the restored version of each file. 
 6. Redeploy your customization, including JSPs, to the WCM portlets if you are using Web Content Manager and you customized the portlets prior to uninstalling the Combined Cumulative fix.  1.

Known issues for latest Combined Cumulative Fix 


Problem: There may be browser / functional issues in themes and in WCM when running 7002 CF levels against Internet Explorer 11 or Microsoft Edge. 
Solution: It is recommended to run these browsers in compatibility mode as necessary. Also, note that some pieces of WCM functionality (exs. inability to close Workflow dialogs, Applet issues) may not work correctly with these browsers even in compatibility mode as they are not supported. 

Problem: Inline help may not appear correctly after CF29 update on zOS. 
Solution: From the <wp_profile_root>/ConfigEngine directory, run task 

./ConfigEngine.sh expand-ear-wp.iehs.ear 

Then restart the Portal server. 


Problem: When using versions earlier than 'Java 6 update 45' or 'Java 7 update 51', a security pop-up dialog or error will be seen every time the WCM FileTransferApplet or Ephox EditLive editor is instantiated. 
Solution: It is recommended to upgrade the Java runtime environment level to either 'Java 6 update 45' or 'Java 7 update 51' or later. Please refer to the following URL: swg21663838 


Problem: After you enter a number into the number element/component, and then save the content/component more than twice, you will notice that the number field gets populated with some dots, i.e. 123.456.78. If you then click on Save again, you will get the following error: 
'Enter a valid number. ( content/component name here)' 
Solution: The workaround is to remove the dots and save again. 


Problem: Page theme is changed to current Portal default theme when changing page content layout. 
Solution: The workaround would be to change the page theme back to "Inherit Parent Theme". A fix for this issue is scheduled to be included in a future Combined CF. 


Problem: After upgrading to a 7.0.0.2 Cumulative Fix and "Portal 7.0.0.2" theme has been set as the default portal theme, a user is unable to post to a blog or update a wiki using Microsoft Windows Internet Explorer. 
Solution: Perform the following steps to resolve the issue:  1. Navigate to Administration -> Manage Pages -> Contenet_Root -> Hidden pages. 
 2. Select "Edit Page Properties" for the hidden page named 'Web Content Management'. 
 3. On the 'Edit page: Web Content Management' page, extend 'Theme:' drop-down list and select "-----Inherit Parent Theme-----".



Problem: WCM Authoring Search may not work after an upgrade to a 7.0.0.2 Cumulative Fix 
Solution: Perform the following steps to resolve the issue:  1. Edit the <wp_profile>/PortalServer/jcr/lib/com/ibm/icm/icm.properties file in a text editor to verify all properties are correct. 
 2. Set jcr.textsearch.enabled=true 
 3. Change jcr.textsearch.indexdirectory to a corresponding location in the filesystem 
 4. Restart your Portal Server. 
 5. Create a new library or make changes in existing libraries



Problem: When configuring Portal for use with a remote DB2 on z/OS database, the sample job provided for the database creation does not contain the statements required to create the storage groups. These take the form: 

CREATE STOGROUP group 
VOLUMES(' volume') 
VCAT category; 
COMMIT; 

where, 
group is the name of the storage group for the database, 
volume is the volume serial number of * to let SMS select the volume where the database will reside, 
category is the category name of the Integrated Catalog Facility. 

Solution: When using the EJPSCRDB sample job add the above statements for each storage group to the final version. These should be added at the beginning of "Step 2" of the sample job, just before the CREATE statements for the actual databases. 


Problem: Theme Policies are not supported by the Portal 7.0.0.2 theme. 
Solution: This is a known limitation. 


Problem: Client-side aggregation is not supported by the Portal 7.0.0.2 theme. 
Solution: This is a known limitation. 


Problem: The WebSphere Portal 7.0.0.2 theme does not support Sametime 8.5.1 
Solution: This is a known limitation. 


Problem: Loading a page with the out of box default profile (Deferred) causes "dojo is not defined" error. 
Solution: Dojo is not available in view mode using the Deferred profile, which is the default out of box. Switch the page or theme to use the Full profile to access Dojo in view mode. For more information see URL: http://www.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/Creating_the_module_profile_sdoc [http://www.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/Creating_the_module_profile_sdoc] 


Problem: The Portal 7.0.0.2 drag-and-drop framework does not support multi-selection and copying resources. 
Solution: This is a known limitation. This can be enabled by creating a custom drag and drop source and enabling these features. 


Problem: The deploy-7002-theme task fails 
Solution: The Portal 7.0.0.2 theme requires several artifacts from the "Page Builder" theme to exist on the server. If you have removed the theme or if you are coming from a migrated environment where the theme never existed, you will need to add the Page Builder theme back to the system before running the deploy-7002-theme task. Please see the "Additional instructions for a migrated environment" section at the following URL for more information http://www.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/Installing_a_new_theme_sdoc [http://www.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/Installing_a_new_theme_sdoc] 


Problem: The Feedspace portlet in Portal 7.0.0.2 may show JavaScript issues. 
Solution: The Feedspace portlet needs to be redeployed to resolve this. Use the Portal administration area to update the the SyndicatedFeedPortlet.war. Use the PortalServer/bp/wp.bp.feedspace/installableApps/SyndicatedFeedPortlet.war to do this update. 


Problem: If a WCM cumulative fix is installed on a Websphere Portal 7.0.0.2 where the date of the install is later than the date on which the cumulative fix was packaged, then the update-wcm task will fail to overwrite the WCM war files from the base version. 
Solution: To workaround this problem, the war files from [PortalServer]\wcm\prereq.wcm\installableApps have to be manually copied to [PortalServer]\installableApps. Once this is done, the update-wcm task will execute successfully. 


Problem: Newly added WCM libraries might not be listed in the "Web Content Libraries" portlet on all nodes of the cluster due to an issue in cache replication. 
Solution: The workaround would be to restart nodes which have the stale library list. A fix for this issue is scheduled to be included in a future Combined CF. 


Problem: After uninstall of the combined cumulative fix, WPVersionInfo shows IBM WebSphere Portal Configuration Framework (CFGFW) at the upgraded version level. 
Solution: This is expected. The CFGFW version level shown after the uninstall of the combined cumulative fix remains at the upgraded level. There is no functional problem. 


Problem: If you plan to configure Computer Associates eTrust SiteMinder as your external security manager to handle authorization and authentication, the XML configuration interface may not be able to access WebSphere Portal through eTrust SiteMinder. 
Solution: To enable the XML configuration interface to access WebSphere Portal, use eTrust SiteMinder to define the configuration URL (/wps/config) as unprotected. Refer to the eTrust SiteMinder documentation for specific instructions. After the configuration URL is defined as unprotected, only WebSphere Portal enforces access control to this URL. Other resources such as the /wps/myportal URL are still protected by eTrust SiteMinder. If you already set up eTrust SiteMinder for external authorization and you want to use XMLConfiguration Interface (xmlaccess), make sure you have followed the procedure to allow for xmlaccess execution. 


Problem: If using the Firefox browser, portlets cannot be dragged to a page from the palette. It is necessary to click the + icon next to the portlet in the palette to add it to the page. 
Solution: This is documented as a known limitation. 


Problem: If an error is seen starting server "WebSphere_Portal" during the upgrade, a possible cause is that this server start is automatically enabled as part of the node reset state. 
The error would appear similar to the following as part of the "action-start-portal-server-standard" task : "ADMU3027E: An instance of the server may already be running: WebSphere_Portal" 
Solution: Log into the WAS Admin Console. Under Application Servers-> WebSphere_Portal, ensure that the Monitoring Policy for "Node restart state" is set to Stopped for all WebSphere Portal servers that are part of the environment.

 IBM WebSphere DataPower M/T 9235 appliance might incorrectly report failure of both power supplies - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 The IBM WebSphere DataPower M/T 9235 appliance might incorrectly report the failure of both power supplies. This message is not reported on all appliances and can occur rarely in the field. 

ANSWER
The following message would be present in the DataPower logs: 

System power supply #2 has failed.

or logging event code: 

0x80400022 System power supply #2 


The problem can be confirmed by issuing the following commands on the appliance CLI:

co 
test hardware 
exit 

The following output from the test hardware command confirms this problem: 

[failure] Power supply '1' has no AC input power, or is not present.
[failure] Power supply '2' has no AC input power, or is not present.

Other results in the test hardware command might also show incorrect values.

This problem does not affect the operation of the appliance other than the continuous reporting power supply failure message. 

To confirm the power supplies are working normally you may check the LED status on the power supplies. If the LED's are green the power supplies are working normally.


To recover from the false errors perform a reboot of the appliance: 

From the WebGUI: 

Control Panel → System Control → In the “Shutdown” section choose “Reboot System” then click “Shutdown” 

 

From the CLI: 

top 

shutdown reboot 

y 


This problem is caused by a highly intermittent error that may allow the sensor reading mechanism to get into a bad state. This bad state then generates the false error messages. In most cases, a reboot of the appliance will reset the sensors and no additional errors are logged. The highly intermittent error rarely occurs again on the same appliance 

If the issue reoccurs on the same appliance contact IBM DataPower support [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21236322] with the following information: 

1) How many times have you seen the issue on the same appliance? 

2) Gather the outputs for the following CLI commands:
show clock
show version
show ipmi
show sensors-other
config
service show
test hardware 

 IBM Default number of threads for ncp_poller - United States Available threads for ncp_poller TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What are the number of threads assigned by default for ncp_poller? Is the same number of threads applicable for additional Pollers too? 

ANSWER
There are 100 threads assigned for default Pollers in all three releases (v3.7, v3.8 & v3.9). 
The additional poller is a new feature in v3.8 and higher versions, so additional Poller threads is not applicable for v3.7. But when you create additional pollers in v3.8/v3.9 same # of thread (i.e. 100) pool is assigned.

In v3.8, v3.9 - you can also increase the default 100 to a higher value by modifying and uncommenting the following line in $NCHOME/etc/precision/NcPollerSchema.cfg
//update config.properties set BatchExtraThreads = 150; 

 IBM Some portal resources have been updated, however a long cache was set so the updates are not being served. - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
The resolver uses the digest to cache some URLs like resource aggregator collections, and the digest remains the same between restarts. Resources like theme files are served from the browser or proxy cache (HTTP 304) and not loaded from the server.


ANSWER
The resolver uses the digest to cache some URLs like resource aggregator collections, and the digest remains the same between restarts. 
In order to force a digest change (should some resources have changed and a long cache was set), you can set the "digest.seed" key in the WP ConfigService to any string value, which will be used in generating a new digest on server boot. This will force a digest change when you want a new one during a restart. 

Changing the digest setting generates different URLs, so the updated theme resources can be loaded from the server. 

 IBM SCA destinations for IBM Business Process Manager (BPM), WebSphere Process Server (WPS) and WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus (WESB) are not preserved when uninstalling and reinstalling a service module - United States SCA.RecycleDestinations; custom properties; SCA destinations; event sequencing; SCA modules; message queue TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When a Service Component Architecture (SCA) module is uninstalled, by default, its associated destinations are removed, even if there are still messages in the destination queue. In some situations, such as when Event Sequencing is used, messages on the destinations must be preserved.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this issue, use the SCA.recycleDestinations custom Java™ virtual machine (JVM) property for the module. Set the property to false to preserve SCA destinations.

 IBM Diagnosing a java.lang.StackOverflowError - United States StackOverflow; overflowing; recursion; recursively; jit; JustInTime; Hot; Spot; WebSphere; Just-In-Time TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Stack Overflow exceptions can occur when a thread stack continues to grow in size until reaching the maximum limit. 

SYMPTOM
 A stack overflow can result from: 

 * A deeply nested application 
 * An infinite loop within an application 
 * A problem in just-in-time (JIT) compiled code 
 * Applications requiring a larger stack size, especially ones relying on XML, GUI, or java2D classes. 
 * Native method calls


Stack overflow issues are frequently masked by Out of Memory exceptions. By resolving the memory constraints, the stack overflow can be resolved. 
CAUSE
When a stack overflow occurs, the amount of stack space required by the program exceeds what is configured for the stack in the Java™ Virtual Machine (JVM) process, or the native stack size configured by the operating system. 
Some applications require stacks that are larger than the default size; for example, a graphics-intensive Java program can require a larger stack, which may require an increase in the stack size to avoid StackOverflow.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Look for either Out of Memory messages or java.lang.StackOverflow in the server logs. The process may continue to run after either of these messages are seen. 


If a crash did occur, a javacore should have generated on IBM SDK. You will either see the signal as SIGSEGV, SIGILL, SIGABRT, or SIGBUS. Usually the current thread will indicate the following




pending=java.lang.StackOverflowError

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21162896&aid=1]Explanations and Solutions
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21162896&amp;aid=2]Detailed Configuration Options 






 

Explanations and Solutions 

Infinite Recursion 
If an application is performing recursion, the maximum stack size can easily be reached and a Stack Overflow exception is thrown. The thread stack has a limited size and eventually its space will run out as the thread stack grows without bounds. 

Some traits of recursion: 
- Large thread stacks that appear to repeat 
- An infinite loop that continuously spawns off threads 
- Very large XML documents loaded into the Document Object Model (DOM) 
- JSP or servlets calling itself (usually by executing forward or include to itself) 
- Repeated calls in native functions 

Increasing the thread stack size allows for larger thread stacks. However if the recursion continues to trigger a stack overflow, the next step is to identify what code is causing the recursion from javacores, thread dumps, or even system core files. 

A thread stack that indicates it's too large to display can be an indicator of stack overflow. This is especially true if the stack appears to repeat (such as recursive method calls). 

JIT/HotSpot Compiled Code 

The JIT/HotSpot compiler (JIT) is designed to speed up the JVM execution times by compiling method calls. This can speed up execution time, but as more aggressive optimizations are used, this can inadvertently cause recursion, resulting in stack overflow or crash. The documents linked below explain how to debug JIT and HotSpot compiler issues:  * JIT Problem Determination for IBM SDK 5.0 and 6.0 using -Xjit [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg21294023] 
 * Debugging HotSpot failures on the Solaris and HP-UX operating environment [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg21081179]



Depleted Native Stack 
It is almost guaranteed that a crash will occur if the native stack runs out of space. System cores can be used to identify long and possibly recursively looping native thread stacks. 

To resolve, increase the native stack size (usually by adjusting the operating system limit for stack size) to accommodate the recursive native calls; however, identifying the recursive native calls will help determine the root cause of the stack overflow.

Detailed Configuration Options 

Adjusting the Stack Sizes (Xss and Xmso) options 
If this does not work, you can adjust the stack sizes. Doubling the stack size is suggested as a first step; however, every thread that the JVM creates will consume memory. Be careful to not exhaust your physical and heap memory resources. 

For every Java thread, there are two stacks that are utilized. One is for Java code for method calls, and the other is for native C code (on Solaris and HP-UX, only the native stack is utilized). These are adjustable and can be raised to provide more room on the stacks to prevent an overflow. 

 * Maximum Thread Stack Size (-Xss)

 IBM How to troubleshoot the error "Failed to process response headers" - United States datapower; failed; parse; process; error; network; connection; persistent; headers; response headers; failed to process response headers; 7993; 7993; 7993; machine type 7993 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What does this error mean?

General error that is always seen:
[servicetype][error] wsgw(policyrule): tid(196761)[error][x.x.x.x]: Failed to process response headers

Specifically from a Web Service Gateway:
[ws-proxy][error] wsgw(Proxy): tid(1234567)[10.2.3.4]: Backside header failed to parse due to: Failed to process response headers
[ws-proxy][error] wsgw(Proxy): tid(1234567)[error][10.2.3.4]: Failed to process response headers 

Additional log information might be seen while at the debug log level.


CAUSE
When you read this error, keep in mind that it is thrown from a rule within a policy of a service. This error almost always means that the policy did not receive any data. If you increase the logging from error to debug, you should see network failures surrounding the response header error.



In almost every event, this error is caused by a connection failure.
The error is correct, the service did not receive any response headers or data. The key to help confirm this is to increase the log level to debug. This will allow you to see the network debug errors around the context of the service error.


ANSWER
The classic causes of this are either of these two: 



 

A slow response that causes the connection to timeout before receiving the response
A failed connection attempt due to a closed persistent connection or some other connection issue that prevents the WebSphere® DataPower device® from connecting to the backend. For example, a reused connection would be attempted and found to already be closed out by something outside of DataPower®.
An example of this is explained here:
http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21417934&wv=1 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21417934&wv=1]

There are a broad range of network errors that can trigger this to error. A packet trace is the key to capture the problem and confirm what type of failure is the cause. A log with event subscription of "all" "debug" will also help correlate and confirm the packet trace data.

In some cases, a simple work around to try is to lower the DataPower persistent timeout or disable persistent connections. If this does not prevent the problem, then analysis of the packet trace and error report are required. 

 IBM Content Collector Configuration Store is corrupted - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM Content Collector Configuration Store Service cannot be started successfully due to database corruption. 

SYMPTOM
Cannot start the IBM Content Collector Configuration Store Service


CAUSE
Transaction log gets corrupted when IBM Content Collector server runs out of disk space. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM



 1. Shutdown the IBM Content Collector Configuration Store Service if it is running. 
 2. Make a backup copy of all files under the following directory:
    C:\ProgramData\IBM\ContentCollector\ConfigurationStore
    
    C:\ProgramData may be hidden by default. Show hidden folders by changing the configuration in Folder and Search options > View tab > Hidden files and folders > Show hidden files, folders, and drives. 
 3. Free up disk space on the drive 
 4. Delete the following files:
    C:\ProgramData\IBM\ContentCollector\ConfigurationStore\logs\*
    C:\ProgramData\IBM\ContentCollector\ConfigurationStore\solmsg.out
    C:\ProgramData\IBM\ContentCollector\ConfigurationStore\solerror.out
    
    Important: 
    Delete only the files under C:\ProgramData\IBM\ContentCollector\ConfigurationStore\logs\. 
    Do not delete the folder itself.
    
 5. If restoring the configuration store to a previously backed up copy is required, run afuConfigStoreTool -backup to restore the backup copy. See production documentation for more information on running this tool. Otherwise, proceed to the next step. 
 6. Restart IBM Content Collector services.

 IBM DataPower Gateways Firmware Support Lifecycle - United States datapower;support;lifecycle;support lifecycle;maintenance;firmware;release;releases;firmware releases;upgrade;upgrades;features;defect NEWS

ABSTRACT
This document provides information on the IBM DataPower Gateway Firmware Support Lifecycle.

CONTENT
IBM® DataPower® Gateway is a purpose-built gateway that provides security, traffic control, mediation and optimized access to a full range of mobile, web, application programming interface (API), service-oriented architecture (SOA), B2B and cloud workloads. It supports multi-cloud deployment and is available in Docker container, Linux application, VMware virtual machine and physical appliance form factors.

IBM provides flexible support options to meet the needs of your business and minimize any business impact. The IBM DataPower Gateways end-of-service support policy applies differently between hardware and firmware.

Hardware 

DataPower physical appliance hardware is supported for a minimum of five years, starting at the General Availability of the new product. Beginning with the 8436 models, standard appliance service and support is available for five years from the end-of-marketing (EOM) date as described in the IBM Appliance Support Handbook [http://www.ibm.com/support/customercare/sas/f/applhandbook/home.html].

For end-of-service information on physical appliances, see IBM DataPower Gateways End of Service dates [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21317845]. 

Firmware 

Businesses are building modernized digital platforms to drive innovation and disruption within the industry. IBM DataPower Gateways are a core component in these platforms and it needs to deliver new business functionality to keep pace with business innovation.

Effective with DataPower Gateway firmware V7.6 [https://www.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?infotype=AN&subtype=CA&htmlfid=897/ENUS217-265&appname=USN], DataPower introduces a Continuous Delivery (CD) model to accelerate delivery of new capabilities and meet market needs. DataPower CD will consist of two releases:

 1. CD release approximately once per quarter  * Only the most recent CD release is supported at a given time.
    
    
 2. Long Term Support (LTS) release every 12 months.  * LTS releases are for customer seeking enhanced stability and do not wish to upgrade on the CD schedule, while CD releases are intended for customers seeking the latest features.
     * The first LTS release post 7.6 GA will be within two years. Subsequent LTS releases will occur every 12 months.
     * LTS releases will be supported for a minimum of 2 years.
    
    

Firmware V7.6 and later have no extended support plan available for any release of DataPower Gateway. IBM will publish a notice of support discontinuance (end-of-service) for a LTS releases at least 12 months before the effective date.

Firmware V7.5 and earlier will remain on the traditional IBM DataPower Gateway support model where they will be supported for a minimum of 2 years. There is no extended support plan available for any of these releases. IBM will publish a notice of support discontinuance (end-of-service) for releases at least 12 months before the effective date.

Note: IBM DataPower Gateways customers can use the following table to track how long their version and release of a particular firmware level will be supported. By using the information in this table, customers can effectively plan their firmware investment without any gaps in support.

 IBM How to format server trace using ARSTFMT on Content Manager OnDemand 8.5.x.x and 9.0.x.x  on Windows platform - United States server trace; ARSTFMT; Content Manager OnDemand TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Formatting CMOD V8.5.x.x and 9.0.x.x Server traces on Windows platform 

SYMPTOM
CMOD Server trace output is unreadable


CAUSE
In CMOD V8.5.0.0 and later, the trace file is written in binary. To convert the trace file from its binary format, use the ARSTFMT command found in the bin directory of your OnDemand server V8.5 and later installation.

ENVIRONMENT
Windows

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Open command prompt - navigate to the CMOD\9.0\bin directory and issue ARSTFMT as follows:

arstfmt -i C:\Users\IBM_ADMIN\path\to\file -o C:\Users\IBM_ADMIN\path\to\file\name.txt




where the C:\Users\IBM_ADMIN\path\to\file is the unreadable trace file and C:\Users\IBM_ADMIN\path\to\file\name.txt is the name of the formatted trace file.

 IBM web server Plugin may need LD_LIBRARY_PATH when used with Apache 2.2 - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM web server Plug-in provides the connection between the web server tier and the IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS) tier.

When using Apache 2.2 web server on Linux operating systems, the IBM web server Plug-in may need to have the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable set in a certain way, in order to be able to locate the IBM Global Security Kit (GSKit) libraries needed for SSL (HTTPS).

Without the GSKit libraries, the IBM web server Plug-in will be unable to initialize SSL, and will use only HTTP for connections to the WAS appservers. 

SYMPTOM
During web server start-up, errors like the following will be logged into the Plug-in log file (http_plugin.log): 

ERROR: lib_security: loadSecurityLibrary: Failed to load gsk library from /opt/IBM/WebSphere/Plugins/gsk8/gsk8_64
ERROR: ws_transport: transportInitializeSecurity: Unable to load security library
ERROR: ws_server: serverAddTransport: Failed to initialize security
ERROR: ws_server: serverAddTransport: HTTPS Transport is skipped


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the problem, you must set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to point to the library directory of the GSKit that comes with the IBM web server Plug-in. The precise directory location will depend of the version of Plug-in, and on the bit depth being used (32-bit or 64-bit). 

 

For example..... 

If you installed the 32-bit Plug-in v7.0 and are using with a 32-bit Apache 2.2, use this: 

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/IBM/WebSphere/Plugins/gsk7/lib/ 

 

If you installed the 64-bit Plug-in v7.0 and are using it with a 32-bit Apache 2.2, use this: 

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/IBM/WebSphere/Plugins/gsk7/gsk7_32/lib/ 

 

If you installed the 64-bit Plug-in v7.0 and are using it with a 64-bit Apache 2.2, use this: 

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/IBM/WebSphere/Plugins/gsk7/gsk7_64/lib64/ 

 

If you installed the 32-bit Plug-in v8.x and are using with a 32-bit Apache 2.2, use this: 

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/IBM/WebSphere/Plugins/gsk8/lib/ 

 

If you installed the 64-bit Plug-in v8.x and are using it with a 32-bit Apache 2.2, use this: 

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/IBM/WebSphere/Plugins/gsk8/gsk8_32/lib/ 

 

If you installed the 64-bit Plug-in v8.x and are using it with a 64-bit Apache 2.2, use this: 

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/IBM/WebSphere/Plugins/gsk8/gsk8_64/lib64/ 

 

 

Please note that for Apache 2.2 on Linux, simply setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable from the command line prior to starting the web server, MAY NOT WORK. In that case, you must set this variable as follows...

For SLES and SUSE Linux add the export command into the /usr/sbin/envvars file.

For RHEL Linux add the export command into the /etc/sysconfig/httpd file.

By adding the export command into the files shown above, it means that the environment variable will be set when the web server is started. That will enable the Plug-in to be able to locate the appropriate GSKit libraries and be able to initialize SSL transports.

 IBM NoClassDefFoundError running Java class selected from server plugin jar - United States wid; noclassdeffounderror; java; jar TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The visual snippet editor allows you to search and find methods in classes available only on a restricted basis at runtime. A runtime exception occurs when the Java™ snippet calls a method in a class found in one of the plugin JARs in the server's plugins directory. 

CAUSE
Some of the Java methods found in the JARs in the server's plugin directory are available to be called, but some of them are considered internal use only and an exception is thrown if you try to call them from user code.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
A runtime exception is detected in the server log naming a class and method called from a visual snippet in the application.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The reason the method you selected in the snippet editor cannot be called in the JAR in the plugins directory is because of the architecture of the server. JARs in the plugins directory have a list that specifies what classes in the JAR can be called. This is called the exports list, and it is honored by the class loader the server uses. Classes not on the list are considered internal use only. Thus, not all classes in the server plugin JARs are available to be called by user code. 

You can call any method when the JAR is in the server's library directorym because it is not being treated as a plugin and a different class loader is used, one which does not implement the exports list.

The snippet editor is not aware of this mechanism so it treats a plugin JAR the same as a regular Java JAR file. That is it allows you to select the (unavailable) class and method to call in your program. The resolution is to make sure that classes you call in plugin JARs appear on the exports list. 

For example you may search for StringUtils and find the class org.apache.commons.lang.StringUtils in the WebSphere JAR plugin/com.ibm.ws.jpa.jar. This class is used internally by the plugin and it is not exported. In this case you must download the class you need directly from Apache and place the JAR in the server's classpath.

This fix resolves the APARs and defects listed in the "Problems Fixed"
section below. 

2.0 Problems fixed
==================
2.1 APARS:
-------------------
APAR: IV79406
Abstract: Duplicated entries of SQL Server on TADDM portal.
Additional Information: SQL Server instance discovered from ITM 
DLA and TADDM Sensor was not reconciling on TADDM 
and duplicates were seen. The reason for duplicates
was that the DLA naming rules were not matching 
with the Sensors naming rules.

APAR: IV82234 
Abstract: False databases are reported as Suspected.
Additional Information: The data collected for Database Detail is written
in <InstanceName>_DBD_PREV file. Due to improper file handling the 
collector logs were written into this file which was causing collector 
logs to be seen on the portal and triggering false alerts.

2.2 DEFECTS:
-----------------
DEFECT: 138512
Abstract: Improvement of table detail (KOQTBLD) algorithm.
Additional Information: The Table Detail information is now sorted 
based on COLL_TBLD_SORTBY. 

DEFECT: 138519
Abstract: Default instance of SQL Server is identified as 'MSSQLSERVER' 
instead of hostname.
Additional Information: The default instance of SQL server used to get 
configured with hostname and not MSSQLSERVER. 
In an environment, where there was default instance and 
a named instance having same name as hostname had issues 
in configuration.

DEFECT: 140838
Abstract: Collector process crashes when collecting Statistics Summary
attribute group.
Additional Information: There was an access violation exception as agent
is trying to read from the memory that is already freed up.

5.0 Installation instructions
=============================
This fix can only be installed over an existing installation. 
Use the following steps to install this fix.

5.1 Before installing the fix
-----------------------------
- The prerequisites listed under section 3.1 entitled 'Prerequisites
for this fix' must be installed before this fix can be installed.

- With reference to this README, the symbol <CANDLEHOME> is the
IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory. The default value
for CANDLEHOME is '/opt/IBM/ITM' on UNIX systems and 'C:\IBM\ITM'
on Windows systems.

Before installing this fix on UNIX systems, set the environment
variable CANDLEHOME to the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation
directory.

For example:
> CANDLEHOME=/opt/IBM/ITM
> export CANDLEHOME

- Refer to section 7.0 entitled "Known problems and workarounds"
before installation.

- Because there is no uninstall utility for this fix, make sure to
perform a backup of your environment before installing this fix.

5.2 Local agent update
----------------------
1. Transfer the appropriate archive file
(6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001.tar or .zip) to a temporary directory
on the system that contains the agent code to be updated. For
the purpose of this README, the symbol <TEMP> represents the
fully qualified path to this directory.
Note: On Windows systems, this path includes the drive letter.

2. Expand the archive file using the "tar" command on UNIX systems
or an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a
directory structure that contains fixes for all of the 
supported platforms.

3. Use the "itmpatch" command to install the fix for that agent
platform. For more information on the "itmpatch" command, see
section 6.2.

On Windows systems, if the fix was expanded to
<TEMP>\6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001, the install command is:

For 32 bit Agent:
> <TEMP>\6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME>
-i <TEMP>\6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\KOQ_winnt_tema_if0001.cab

For 64 bit Agent:
> <TEMP>\6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> 
-i <TEMP>\6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\KOQ_wix64_tema_if0001.cab

Note : Use "itmpatch" command from <TEMP>\6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\ 
temporary directory.

5.3 Remote agent update
-----------------------
1. Transfer the appropriate archive file
(6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001.tar or .zip) to a temporary directory
on the IBM Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server system. For the
purpose of this README, the symbol <TEMP> represents the fully
qualified path to this directory.
Note: On Windows systems, this path includes the drive letter.

2. Expand the archive file using the "tar" command on UNIX systems
or an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a 
directory structure that contains fixes for all of the 
supported platforms.

3. To add the agent fix bundles into the remote deploy depot, use
the "tacmd addBundles" command found in $CANDLEHOME/bin on UNIX
systems or in %CANDLE_HOME%\bin on Windows systems. For more
information on the "tacmd addBundles" command, see the IBM Tivoli
Monitoring Administrator's Guide.

On UNIX systems,
if the fix was expanded to <TEMP>/6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001:
> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd addBundles -n -i <TEMP>/6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001

On Windows systems,
if the fix was expanded to <TEMP>\6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001:
> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd addBundles -n -i <TEMP>\6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001

where:
-n indicates that prerequisite bundles are not automatically
added. The -n parameter must be used because the fix 
directory does not contain any prerequisites that the fix
might require. Please see Section 3.1 for the prerequisites
for this fix.
-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to 
be added to the depot. 

4. To log in to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring server, and deploy
the fix to the appropriate nodes where the agent is running, use
the following "tacmd" commands. For more information on the
"tacmd login" and "tacmd updateAgent" commands, see "IBM Tivoli 
Monitoring Command Reference".

On UNIX systems: 
> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>
-u <itmuser>
-p <password>

> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems

The output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the
remote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the
"tacmd updateAgent" command.

> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd updateAgent -t OQ -n <Managed system name> -v 063108001

On Windows systems:
> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd login -s <server>
-u <itmuser>
-p <password>

> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd listSystems

The output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the
remote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the
"tacmd updateAgent" command.

> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd updateAgent -t OQ -n <Managed system name> -v 063108001

Note:
- The component (-t) for the "tacmd updateAgent" command is 
specified as two characters (oq), not three characters (koq).
- The node (-n) for the "tacmd updateAgent" command is the
managed system name of the operating system (OS) agent to be
updated.
The target node for the "tacmd updateAgent" command is always
an OS agent.

5. To check if Remote Agent Update is SUCCESS/INPROGRESS/FAILED use the command 
>tacmd getDeployStatus <transaction id>

where transaction id is the id provided after updateAgent command.

5.4 Agent support update
------------------------
Use the following steps to update the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server, 
Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop.

1. Transfer the appropriate archive file
6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001.tar or .zip) to the 
Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Servers, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Servers
or Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktops.

2. Expand the archive file using the "tar" command on UNIX systems
or an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a 
directory structure that contains fixes for all of the supported
platforms.

3. Expand the archive file (koq_tems_teps_tepd_if0001.tar or .zip)
that contains the updates for Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server, 
Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, and Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop 
using the "tar" command on UNIX systems or an 
extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a 
directory structure that includes a subdirectory called CD-ROM,
with the necessary updates.

4. Use the Application Support Installer(ASI) script to launch either 
GUI installation or silent installation of the application 
support files. 

Note: For IBM Tivoli Monitoring Version 6.3 or above, one
of the following additional steps must be performed.

1. Acquire a platform-specific pre-packaged JRE version 
of the Application Support Installer (ASI). See IBM 
Tivoli Monitoring Application Support Installer, 
6.2-TIV-ITM_ASI-IF0002 at 
http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034924 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034924]
for download and installation instructions.

2. Specify the '-j javahome' parameter with the path to 
a java(r) 1.5 or java 1.6 installation when running 
the itmasi.sh or itmasi.bat script described below. 

GUI installation option
------------------------
The GUI can be started by using one of the following commands
from within the CD-ROM directory where setup.jar is located.

On UNIX systems:
> ./itmasi.sh [-h <CANDLEHOME>] [-j <JAVAHOME>] 

On Windows systems:
> itmasi [-h <CANDLEHOME>] [-j <JAVAHOME>] 

where:
-h <CANDLEHOME> - Required. The path to the IBM Tivoli
Monitoring installation directory.

-j <JAVAHOME> - Optional. The fully-qualified path to the
"bin" directory where Java(R) is installed.
The location of Java on your system might
vary.

When prompted by the Application Support Installer for the 
installable media directory, select the CD-ROM directory, not
the component directory. The installer can install updates for 
multiple components at the same time.

Silent installation option
--------------------------
To use the silent installation option, use one of the following
commands from within the CD-ROM directory where setup.jar is 
located. 

Note: Agent support upgrade for IBM Tivoli Monitoring Version 6.3 
or above on Linux, zLinux, Solaris and windows operating systems 
requires the following files contained in interim fix 
6.2-TIV-ITM_ASI-IF0002. This is applicable to both GUI and 
silent installation option of agent support upgrade.
- Linux: setupLinux.bin
- zLinux: setupLinux390.bin
- Solaris: setupSolaris.bin
- Windows: setupwin32.exe

Follow the installation instructions contained in the
"6.2-TIV-ITM_ASI-IF0002.README".

On UNIX systems:
> ./itmasi.sh -h <CANDLEHOME>[-silent] 
[-r <response file>] 
[-j <JAVAHOME>] 

On Windows systems:
> itmasi -h <CANDLEHOME> [-silent] 
[-r <response file>] 
[-j <JAVAHOME>] 

where:
-h <CANDLEHOME> - Required. The path to the IBM Tivoli
Monitoring installation directory.

-r <response file> - Required. Customized response file name.
The default response file "response.txt" in
the CD-ROM directory can be copied and
modified as per your environment.

-j <JAVAHOME> - Optional. The fully-qualified path to the
"bin" directory where Java(R) is installed.
The location of Java on your system might
vary.

5. The next panel presented by the Application Support Installer 
asks for the selection of which Tivoli Monitoring components
you want to add application support to.
For this fix, the check boxes should be set as follows:

Unchecked - Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server(TEMS)
Checked - Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server(TEPS)
Checked - Tivoli Enterprise Desktop Client(TEPD)

Continue through the remaining GUI panels selecting the
Microsoft SQL Server 06.31.08.01 support to complete the
installation.

Note: When support is installed using CLI or GUI for any of the
above Tivoli Monitoring components, they are restarted. 


6. If the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop or Tivoli Enterprise
Portal Browser was running when the update was installed, it
must be restarted.


6.0 Additional installation information
=======================================
Any existing Microsoft SQL Server Agent instances should be restarted
after the installation of this fix.

6.1 Installation instructions for agent baroc file
--------------------------------------------------
Fix (6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001) includes changes to the agent
baroc files which need to be reinstalled. If you have already
installed these baroc files, there are no additional installation
steps. If not, refer to IBM Tivoli Monitoring, Installation
and Setup Guide under "Installing monitoring agent baroc files
on the event server" in "Installing the IBM Tivoli Enterprise
Console Event Synchronization" section for more information.

6.2 Additional information on using "itmpatch" command
----------------------------------------------------
The "itmpatch" command has the following syntax.

Usage: itmpatch -h <installation home> [OPTIONS]

itmpatch -h <installation home>
-t { <patch_file_directory> | <patch_file> }

itmpatch -h <installation home>
-i { <patch_file_directory> | <patch_file> }

where:
-h Specifies the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory
-i Specifies the path to the directory or patch file to be 
installed
-t Generates a report of the actions to be taken by the patch

For example, on UNIX systems:
- To preview the fix installation, use the "-t" option:
> <CANDLEHOME>/bin/itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> -t <TEMP>

- To install the fix, use the "-i" option:
> <CANDLEHOME>/bin/itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> -i <TEMP>

where:
<CANDLEHOME> is the fully qualified IBM Tivoli Monitoring 
installation directory. On Windows systems, this path must include
the drive letter.
<TEMP> represents the fully qualified directory specification where
the fix is located. On Windows systems, this must include the drive
letter.

6.3 Verifying the update
------------------------
1. To verify the agent was updated correctly, use the "tacmd" command
to view the agent's current version after the agent is restarted.
You are required to log in to a Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring
Server prior to viewing the agent version.

For example:
On UNIX systems, where $CANDLEHOME is the IBM Tivoli 
Monitoring installation directory, the default location
is '/opt/IBM/ITM'.

> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>
-u <itmuser>
-p <password>
> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems -t OQ

On Windows systems, where %CANDLE_HOME% is the IBM Tivoli
Monitoring installation directory, the default location
is 'C:\IBM\ITM'.

> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd login -s <server>
-u <itmuser> 
-p <password>

> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd listSystems -t OQ 

Note:
- The component (-t) for the tacmd "listSystems" command is 
specified as two characters (OQ), not three characters (KOQ).

When the agent update is successful, the agent version is:
06.31.08.01.

After the agent is restarted, you can also use the GUI to verify
the agent was successfully updated.
For the agent on Windows systems, the version number is 
06.31.08.01.

2. To verify the agent support files were updated correctly, use 
the "kincinfo" command on Windows systems or the "cinfo" command
on Linux or UNIX systems. The sample output below shows the 
versions of the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, Tivoli 
Enterprise Monitoring Server, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal
Desktop systems after this fix has been successfully applied.

Note: The displayed build date and installation date might not 
be accurate. This is known problem.

On UNIX or Linux systems:
-------------------------
To validate that all components have been installed, run the
following command:

./cinfo -i

On Windows systems:
-------------------
To validate that all components have been installed, run the
following command:

For example:
> %CANDLE_HOME%\InstallITM\kincinfo -i

C:\Users\Administrator>kincinfo -i

7.0 Known problems and workarounds
==================================
Abstract: itmpatch command fails during upgrade
Problem: When itmpatch command is executed, it fails while upgrading
agent fix pack. The following error message is 
displayed: 

Version 06.31.08.XX of product koq is currently installed.
The patch requires that you must have at least version
06.31.08.XX of product installed to apply this patch.
Workaround: Use the itmpatch.exe provided in patch file 
6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-XXXXXX.zip or 
6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-XXXXXX.tar file.

Abstract: English characters are getting displayed in Agent support 
installer having Non-English language operating system.
Problem: In Non-English language operating system, when agent 
support installer is executed it shows English characters.
Workaround: None

Abstract: Installing support for patch fails on ITM 6.3.0
Problem: When you try to install the support for this patch on ITM
6.3.0, the installation fails with following error:
The wizard cannot continue because of the following error: 
could not load wizard specified in /wizard.inf (104)
Workaround: Use the pre-packaged binaries for itmasi available at:
http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034924 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034924]

Abstract: Crash encountered in event viewer for koqagent.exe
Problem: Sometimes while stopping the koqagent process, the collection
process is not getting completed. When koqagent.exe stops, the
thread spawned by it gets terminated forcefully. Hence it's
causing a crash.
Workaround: None

Abstract: Application support installation fails on Non Windows OS.
Problem: While installing the application support on the machines
having Operating system other than windows, the support
installation using ASI fails if the temporary directory 
where the patch files are extracted has spaces.
Workaround: Use the temporary directory without space.

Abstract: MSSQL Agent collector crashes.
Problem: Sometimes the job 'syspolicy_purge_history' fails and 
the collector crashes.
Workaround: 1. Disable scheduling of system job 'syspolicy_purge_history'.
2. Disable detail trace logging.

Abstract: MSSQL Agent collector process keeps on restarting.
Problem: If the default instance is configured before patch upgrade then 
after patch upgrade the collector process keeps on restarting 
Workaround: In this patch, the name of default instance is changed from 
HOSTNAME to MSSQLSERVER (Defect 138519). Hence, the previously 
configured default instance with name as HOSTNAME will not 
work properly. So, it is required to unconfigure default 
instance (with name hostname) and configure it with name as 
MSSQLSERVER.

Following are the steps to unconfigure and configure:
1. Open Manage Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Services 
(MTEMS) window. 
2. Right click on template row and go to 
"Configure Using Defaults".
3. Select the default instance with name as HOSTNAME 
from 'Server To Monitor' list box and click on ">>" button 
to unconfigure it.
4. Select the instance with name 'MSSQLSERVER' in 
'Database Servers Available' list box and click on "<<" button
to configure this instance.

 IBM ERRORCODE=-4499, The application server rejected establishment of the connection. - United States -4499; JCC; SQL State = 08004; Error Code = -4; 499 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 
Attempt to connect to a database using Type 4 JCC driver fails with the following exception:

java.sql.SQLException: 
[jcc][t4][2057][11264][3.53.95] The application server rejected establishment of the connection. An attempt was made to access a database, <database name>, which was either not found or does 
not support transactions. ERRORCODE=-4499, 
SQLSTATE=08004 DSRA0010E: SQL State = 08004, Error Code = -4,499 



CAUSE
Using DCS DB alias or local alias name of the database in the connection string will cause this error.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

The URL format for IBM Data Server Driver for JDBC and SQLJ type 4 connectivity is:


 *  "jdbc:db2://<server name>: <portnumber>/<database name>"; 


In the Type 4 JDBC JCC driver connection string used, 
 *  If the connection is to a DB2 for Linux,Unix,Windows server, the database name should be the Target database name in the database server, it should not be the local alias name cataloged in the client. 
 *  If the connection is to a DB2 for z/OS server, database name is the DB2 location name that is defined during installation. All characters in the DB2 location name must be upper-case characters. The IBM Data Server Driver for JDBC and SQLJ does not convert lower-case characters in the database value to upper-case for IBM Data Server Driver for JDBC and SQLJ type 4 connectivity. 
 * The location name can be found by executing the following SQL statement on the server:  * SELECT CURRENT SERVER FROM SYSIBM.SYSDUMMY1;
   
   
   The target database name can also be found from the DCS directory on the client using the command:  * db2 list dcs directory.

 IBM .NET API error when installing IBM Content Collector (ICC) 4.0.1 - United States ICC; .NET API; CPE 5.2.1.2 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 A .NET API error is thrown when attempting to install ICC 4.0.1. The error claims that either an incorrect version of the IBM FileNet P8 Content Processing Engine (CPE) .NET API 5.2.1.2 is installed or that it is missing some components. 

CAUSE
A corrupt installation of the CPE 5.2.1.2.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
1. Check in "Programs and features"
2. .NET API will not be listed there

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Re-installing the CPE 5.2.1.2 .NET API will solve this issue:




1. Copy the software on a local disk.
2. Start the re-installation of the .NET API.
3. Select all sub-components of .NET framework 45 that were not listed before (select them all if unsure). 

During the next installation of ICC there are no further errors regarding missing components. 

 IBM Using the "reinitialize" CLI command to reconfigure an appliance. - United States datapower; init; initialize; reinitialize; reinit; reset; factory settings; settings; 7993; 7993; 7993; machine type 7993 DPRecovery TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 If you need to reconfigure an IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA appliance you can use the "reinitialize" CLI command. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Note: The appliance should NOT be initialized if sitation described in the technote exists - http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21659259 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21659259] - appliance gets into Fail-Safe mode. It may be necessary to return the appliance to IBM for repair.
The reinit CLI command will allow you to reconfigure an IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA appliance. The reinit CLI command will allow you to delete (not erase) all existing configuration and data from an IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA appliance.

When the reinitialize command completes, your network IP configurations, user accounts and other configuration options, are no longer accessible. 

You will only be able to connect to the appliance using the serial connection. 

You will need to configure your Ethernet and all other settings again using the information in the product information center available from our library page [http://www.ibm.com/software/integration/datapower/library/index.html].

Important points: 

 * Make sure you have a working serial connection to the appliance. 
   
   
 * The admin password will revert to the initial value of "admin" after the command executes.
   
   
 * A firmware image must be on the appliance prior to running the command. The firmware image used for the last upgrade of the device is removed from the file system automatically when the device reboots. Use DataPower's File Management WebGUI option to confirm you have an image or use these CLI commands:
   xi52# configure
   xi52# dir image:
   If an image file is not found, you will need to load a firmware image to the appliance into the image:/// directory. For example: you can use the WebGUI file management options or from the Control Panel, choose the System Control icon, the under Boot Image, choose the firmware file upload options.
   
   
 * Use the DataPower File Management to confirm you have sufficient file space. If you don't have sufficient file space, you can delete domains or other files to free up file space to allow the firmware image to be loaded to the appliance. 
   
   
 * reinit is a CLI command available in the config-flash# mode, for example:
   
   xi52# configure terminal
   Global configuration mode 
   xi52(config)# flash 
   Flash configuration mode 
   xi52(config-flash)#
   reinit <filename> 
   
   Where <filename> represents a firmware image contained within the image:/// directory. This will be the firmware image which will be installed during the reinit process. For more CLI commands, refere to the following doc link:
   http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wsdatap/v5r0m0/nav/4_4 [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wsdatap/v5r0m0/nav/4_4] 
   
   
 * After the appliance reboots:  *  If the firmware image used was for V5 or newer, you will need to accept the license at first logon to the WebGui Configure the appliance per the instructions in the appliances configuration guide. This and other documentation on the appliance is available from our library page [http://www.ibm.com/software/integration/datapower/library/index.html]. 
   
   



The command is documented in the information center. This and other documentation on the appliance is available from our library page [http://www.ibm.com/software/integration/datapower/library/index.html]. 

If your appliance has the optional RAID (hard drives) reinitialize the RAID using the information in our RAID technote [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21358544]. 

If your appliance has the optional HSM, reinitialize the HSM following the instructions in our HSM book or infocenter for your release of the product. These are available on our library page [http://www.ibm.com/software/integration/datapower/library/documentation/].

 IBM Generating Java diagnostic dumps for IBM Integration Bus - United States mqiinfo; java dumps; java core; core; force TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Use the procedures below to collect java diagnostics dumps from IBM Integration Bus (IIB).

Java diagnostic dumps contain:
- all Java threads running in a process (Java core or javacore files)
- objects populating the heap space (Heap dump or heapdump files)
- tracepoint information (Snap trace or snaptrace files)
- internal system information (System dump)

These files can be used to diagnose problems such as lock conditions, loops, or memory allocation in Java code. 

Gathering this information before calling IBM Support will help familiarize you with the troubleshooting process and save you time. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM


JAVACORE DUMP INSTRUCTIONS

New javacore dump commands have been made available from IIB v10.0.0.9, onwards. 
- The new procedure uses the mqsichangeproperties command. 
- The old procedure uses a custom message flow, and is only applicable for operating systems that use the IBM JRE. 

Note: 
Collection of Java core dumps is an invasive activity and will impact the performance of the Integration Server process. 

JAVA DUMP COMMAND FOR IIB V10.0.0.9+
Use this command to generate a Java dump on IIB v10.0.0.9+:
mqsichangeproperties <Int.Node> -e <Int.Server> -o ComIbmInternalSupportManager/Java/JVM -n dump -v <dump_type>

The following dump types are supported:

All Platforms 

-v heap Produces a Java Heap dump 

IBM JRE Platforms (All platforms except HP and Solaris) -v core Produces a javacore -v system Produces a system dump -v all Produces a heapdump, javacore, and system dump 
Dump files are output to $MQSI_WORKPATH/common/errors 

JAVA DUMP PROCEDURE FOR IIB PRIOR TO V10.0.0.9
Use this procedure to create an IIB message flow that will trigger a Java dump for an Integration Server:

1. Create a new message flow containing an Input node and a JavaCompute node.
2. In the JavaCompute node, call the method 'com.ibm.jvm.Dump.JavaDump()'.
3. Deploy your message flow to the target Integration Server.
4. Recreate the conditions that necessitate the Java dump.
5. Invoke your message flow by sending a message to the Input node.
6. The dump files should be output to $MQSI_WORKPATH/common/errors.

Note:
This procedure requires the use of the IBM JRE.
Therefore, it is not suitable on Solaris or HP platforms which do not use the IBM JRE.

 How to configure an IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance Service to proxy an SSL request to a remote proxy server using the CONNECT method for SSL tunneling? 

CAUSE
Many common forward proxy servers expect requests in different formats depending on if they are proxying non-SSL or SSL requests.

For example, a non-SSL request to be proxied may come in the form of GET hostname:port/URI.

For SSL requests to be proxied, remote proxy servers are commonly configured to tunnel the request from the client to the backend server.

In the SSL request scenario, remote proxy servers will typically expect a CONNECT request and then tunnel the SSL request from the client to the backend server.

Users configuring DataPower may need a way to implement this CONNECT method for SSL tunneling to a remote Proxy Server.




RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Non-SSL Proxy requests will work using either:

a) an XML Firewall when configuring in the HTTP Options tab, where the user can configure the Proxy Host and Port

b) a Multi-Protocol Gateway when configuring an HTTP Proxy Policy in the User Agent

SSL Proxy requests will work using the CONNECT method for SSL Tunneling when using a Multi-Protocol Gateway when configuring in a User Agent's HTTP Proxy Policy.

The XML Firewall service is not designed to use the CONNECT method for SSL Tunneling. 

 IBM EIF probe not receiving itm events - United States om_tec.conf eif probe itm event clearing omnibus TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 ITM is sending events to EIF probe which is then forwarded to the OMNIbus Server. Client is observing that the clearing event is sent per the ITM trace/log but the event does not seem to be received into EIF or OMNIbus as the triggered event is still seen in OMNIbus.



SYMPTOM
Situation in ITM is no longer true but event is not cleared in OMNIbus.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The iptrace shows that the EIF probe on the OMNIbus side is resetting/closing(<RST>) the TCP/IP connection after it receives the event and it never shows up in the EIF logs, so the event is just dropped.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The solution is to set the connection_mode in your om_tec.config on the ITM Server (TEMS) to use 


connection_less 

instead of 

connection oriented.

That is, change this line in your om_tec.config

ConnectionMode=co
to
ConnectionMode=connection_less

You will need to restart the EIF on your ITM. (tacmd refreshTECinfo -t eif) 

 IBM What are the supported Apple Macintosh Operating System Versions for IBM SPSS Statistics? - United States SPSS mac macintosh Apple Macintosh statistics OS supported version compatibility matrix leopard Snow Leopard Lion Mountain Lion 10.8 Mavericks 10.9 22 Yosemite 10.10 (Yosemite) el capitan 10.11 spss 24 Sierra 10.12 High Sierra 10.13 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I would like to know what are the supported Macintosh Operating system versions for IBM SPSS Statistics versions? 

ANSWER
Please see the list below. It is strongly recommended to review the platform information on IBM Software Product Compatibility Reports [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/prodguid/v1r0/clarity/index.jsp]. The installation of IBM SPSS Statistics software on Apple Macintosh OSX operating systems requires an Intel processor. 

A) Apple Macintosh MacOS High Sierra (10.13) 

Support for IBM SPSS Statistics 25 only. Please note that no other SPSS release will be officially supported on High Sierra, but older versions like SPSS Statistics 24 may run as well on High Sierra. 

NOTE: There's a known issue with some of the earlier release of Mac High Sierra system (13.0 and 13.1 beta version). 
The top menu of SPSS 25 may disappear if the Mac OS system is set to Non-English. 
The official MacOSX 10.13.1 version do not have this issue. So, if you encountert this issue you need to update your Mac OS version to latest official 10.13.1 build from Apple. 

 

B) Apple Macintosh MacOS Sierra (10.12) 

Support for IBM SPSS Statistics 25 and IBM SPSS Statistics 24 only. For release 24 It is also recommended to install the latest FixPack 2 for release 24 on Mac [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24043574]. [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24042675] 

No older SPSS Statistics releases are supported on Sierra. 

 

C) Apple Macintosh OSX El Capitan (10.11) 

Support for IBM SPSS Statistics 24. Please see the Release notes - IBM SPSS Statistics 24.0 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27047057] for known issues on Macintosh. 

Full documentation including installation material provided in different languages and manuals for release 24 can be found on IBM SPSS Statistics 24 Documentation [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27047033] webpage. 

 

Also, Support for IBM SPSS Statistics 23. Note: if you want to install on El Capitan, please refer to technote 1970391 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21970391] 

 

D) Apple Macintosh OSX Yosemite (10.10)

Note: Mac OSX 10.10 (Yosemite) was released on Thursday, October 16th 2014 by Apple after Statistics 22 was released. If you like to use Statistics 22 on Yosemite you need to install Statistics 22 Fixpack 2 as well. Statistics 22 FixPack 2 and release Statistics 23 are fully tested on Yosemite OSX 10.10. So if you like to run Statistics 22 on Yosemite please install Statistics 22 FixPack 2 and also read the section below: 

**** 

In some instances it can be necessary to re-install the legacy Apple Java 6 on 10.10 for the use of Statistics 22 FixPack 2 on this platform

Download and re-install Apple Java 6 

- After you upgraded your Apple Mac OSX from a previous release to 10.10, Apple Java 6 may no longer exists on your upgraded system. If you then launch Statistics 22 which is an application that relies on Java 6, it can happen, the Mac OS pops up a dialog box stating Java 6 was requested, but none is present.
- The Java dialog has a "More Info" button, which when clicked opens a browser to an Apple Tech Support page for Apple Java 2014-001. A download link is provided:
http://support.apple.com/kb/dl1572 [http://support.apple.com/kb/dl1572]
- Click on the download link and a DMG containing the Java 6 installer is downloaded.

 IBM Case insensitive searches in IBM Content Navigator - United States ICN case sensitive TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How can a search field be enabled as case insensitive in IBM Content Navigator (ICN)? 

ANSWER
ICN does not provide a feature to turn on or off case sensitive searches. All metadata searches in ICN are case sensitive by default. However, depending on the repository, case insensitive searches can be performed by doing the following:
- For FileNet P8 repositories; set the Force Case Insensitive Search flag on the object store. 
- For Content Manager repositories; the administrator will firstly need to enable text search on metadata, then a text search will need to be done in ICN against the metadata by enclosing the metadata value in double quotes.

Alternatively, a request filter can be written to change the case of a query to all upper or all lower case. 

 IBM FileNet Workplace XT war and ear files are unusually small - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When creating the IBM FileNet Workplace XT archive files with either the Content Platform Engine Client Files installation or the IBM Case Manager's "Deploy IBM FileNet Workplace XT" configuration manager task , the resulting war and ear files are only a few kilobytes in size and contain the create_web_client_war.sh and create_web_client_ear.sh files.



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The ceclient_install_log or warerr.log file will contain the following error:

ERROR:
"create_web_client_war.sh[5]: cd: .WorkplaceXT: [No such file or
directory]"

When attempting to install the resulting archive file to IBM WebSphere Application Server, the following error is returned.

IWAE0006E Archive is not a valid WAR File because the deployment descriptor can not be found (case sensitive): WEB-INF/web.xml 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The create_web_client_war.sh script that creates the web_client.war file contains a change directory (CD) operating system command so the WorkplaceXT directory will be included in the archive. This CD command fails with a "No such file or directory" error. 

This failure can be caused by the CDPATH operating system environment variable being set. The CDPATH environment variable is used to define the base directory to be used for the CD command. A side effect of setting the CDPATH is that CD commands in scripts may jump to unintended directories. 

 

For example, the error below indicates that the operating system cannot find the WorkplaceXT directory off the root of the file system instead of the expected "<WorkplaceXT_install_directory>/IBM/FileNet/webclient/" directory. 

 

ERROR:
"create_web_client_war.sh[5]: cd: .WorkplaceXT: [No such file or
directory] 

 

To resolve this problem, unset the CDPATH operating system environment variable while creating the IBM FileNet Workplace XT war and ear files.

 IBM MQJMS1068 error occurs when trying to create an XA connection from WebSphere Application Server to MQ - United States MQPRB MQPRB3189 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When attempting to create an XA connection to WebSphere® MQ from either WebSphere Application Server Version 7.x or Version 8.x with a connection factory that uses the Client Channel Definition Table (CCDT), the following error appears in the application server's SystemOut.log file: 

 J2CA0056I: The Connection Manager received a fatal connection error from the Resource Adaptor for resource <connection factory>. The exception which was received is javax.jms.JMSException: MQJMS1068: failed to obtain XAResource 



CAUSE
The reason why it is not possible to use the CCDT with XA connections is related to transaction recovery. 

 If the application server stops while there are still active transactions, there is no way with the current implementation to ensure that it will connect to the same queue manager when it restarts. This can lead to in-doubt transactions being left dangling, and never resolved. 

 It is hoped that this restriction will be resolved in future releases of WebSphere Application Server and WebSphere MQ.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The use of the Client Channel Definition Table (CCDT) with XA connections is not supported.

Getting background information on EJBDeploy 

 All Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE ) EJB applications go through an EJB deployment phase in which your application is customized to run in an application server. Typically, this is accomplished by a deployment tool that is specific to the application server. It generates code to allow your EJB to run within an EJB container. Some application server products' deployment tools alter the bytecode of your application classes rather than generating code ;however, the end result is similar. 

The EJBDeploy Tool 

Historically, EJB deployment in the Application Server product has been performed by the EJBDeploy tool, which is included with WebSphere® Application Server and packaged with the development tools for the WebSphere products. 
The EJBDeploy tool inspects the external interfaces for your enterprise beans, generates wrapper code as .java files, and compiles the code using the javac compiler. The resulting .class files are packaged in your EJB module with your application code. For modules including and previous to EJB 2.1, the EJBDeploy tool must be invoked manually. 
Please note that in WebSphere Application Server 8.5.5.x and below, the tool can only deploy Java EE applications compiled with a JDK level of 7 or below. To deploy JDK 8 compiled web applications, please upgrade to WebSphere Application Server V9.

 IBM WCM page and authoring portlet may not display after migration - United States WPv7000eGA; migrating; migrate; migration; V7.0; v7; WCM; out-of-box page; out of the box; page; authoring portlet; may not reach; cannot reach; cannot access; no access; exceptions; IWKAP0009E; Servlet not enabled TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
After migrating to IBM WebSphere Portal V7.0, you may not be able to navigate to or display the Web Content Manager (WCM) out-of-box page or the authoring portlet. In addition, some related functions in the user interface might not work or might generate exceptions when accessed. Clicking buttons in the authoring portlet may generate the following error in the log: 

 * 
 * IWKAP0009E: Servlet not enabled
 * 


If this occurs, you must re-enable these features manually after migration. 
CAUSE
The migration process can disable some new out-of-the-box features if the feature did not exist in the previous release or if it was updated. In particular, the Portal page required for the reserved authoring portlet is missing and the permissions on the AJAX proxy servlet are not set correctly.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To re-enable the affected features manually after migration, do the following: 


1. Make sure that the page on which the WCM authoring portlet is installed uses a theme with client-side rendering such as the Page Builder theme.

2. Deploy the hidden Portal page on which the reserved authoring portlet is installed. 


3. Run the following task from the wp_profile_root / Config Engine directory. 
 * Cluster note:
 * 

 * Windows:
 *  
 * 
 * ConfigEngine.bat install-wcm-hidden-authoring-page -DWasPassword=

 IBM After restoring BigFix server database, ILMT/BFI/SUA server may not import all the data since the restore correctly - United States sequance number; resotre; database; missing data; gap TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

THIS DOCUMENT APPLIES ONLY TO THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGE VERSION(S):
 English 

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After you restore the BigFix database and run an import, new data is not displayed in BFI/SUA/LMT even after successful ETL imports. 

SYMPTOM
Not all data reported already by endpoints to BigFix server are visible in LMT/BFI console. This may include scan results, capacity data, etc.


CAUSE
BFI/SUA/LMT is designed to import only newly created data. To achieve this, the data is marked with the so-called sequence number. The sequence number is incremented during every change, upload, scan, etc. Every import contains data starting from the sequence number reported during the last successful import to the current sequence number. 

When the database is restored, the sequence number is restored to the value from the time when the database backup was created. Because of that, it might happen that the sequence number after the restoration is lower than the sequence number reported during the last successful import. In such case, the first import after the database restoration does not include any data. After that import, the sequence number is updated and the next import contains new data. Depending on your scan settings, you might need to wait some time for the import that contains new data. 

When the database is restored, the sequence number is restored to the value from the time when the database backup was created.

Data for the period from the last successful import before the restoration of the database until the restoration is never imported (obviously, as the data was removed by restoring the DB) and needs to be re-generated by re-running the scans if needed. 

Data from DB restoration time until first successful import is also by default not imported (causing a gap). To cover this gap you may follow the procedure described below.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Warning: The following procedure will impact the length of the first import after the sequence is reset. After performing below steps ALL DATA from all endpoints available on BigFix server side will be imported (not only covering the problematic gap). For big environments the impact may be huge and it is better to re-run scans on selected endpoints instead.

1) Ensure that the import is not running and stop the BFI/SUA/LMT server.
2) To reset the sequence for all data sources and import all data, run the following query on the BFI/SUA/LMT database:

DB2:
UPDATE dbo.DATASOURCE_SEQUENCES set LAST_SEQUENCE = blob(x'0000000000000000');

MSSQL:
UPDATE dbo.datasource_sequences set last_sequence = 0x0000000000000000;

3) Start the BFI/SUA/LMT. 
4) Run an import.

 IBM Configuring the Tomcat Data Collector to run as a Windows service - United States ITCAM; J2EE; Tomcat; Windows; Service; CAMJ2ALL; CAMJ2INST; CAMJ2TCDC TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What is the correct procedure to configure the ITCAM for J2EE Data Collector for Tomcat to run as a Windows service? 

CAUSE
There is an option to specify the Tomcat Windows Service during GUI configuration of the ITCAM J2EE 7.1.1 agent/DC. This option does not work and will result in a failed configuration.



[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21961542&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21961542&aid=1]

This option will be removed from the drop down menu for the Tomcat DC Configuration, according to APAR PI43783.


ANSWER
Tomcat on Windows platforms must be installed from a base distribution, that is extracting a .zip file named like apache-tomcat-7.0.62.zip, even though one plans to start Tomcat only as a Window Service, and not with a startup script. 


If you install Tomcat from the Windows Service Installer (e.g. apache-tomcat-7.0.62.exe), rather than a base distribution, some of the command-line and startup scripts for launching Tomcat will not be included, and you won't be able to complete the following procedure.


1- Configure the DC using the Normal Startup option.

 IBM HTTP Session time-out settings and overwrite precedence rules - United States WebSphere http session management time-out wasrun precedence overwrite TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 It is possible to set the HTTP Session time-out in various places on the IBM® WebSphere® Application Server Administrative Console. It is also possible to set HTTP Session time-out for the application packaging process. 

Since Session time-out can be set in multiple places, it is necessary to understand how the ultimate Session time-out for an application is determined. 

CAUSE
Application needs HTTP session time-out set.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The HTTP Session time-out can be set in the following places: 

 * From the Administrative Console at the server, Enterprise application, and Web application levels 
 * At the time when the application is packaged 
 * In the application code


Setting the HTTP Session time-out from the Administrative Console 
1. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the server level, navigate to Servers > Application Servers > Your Server > Web Container > Session Management. 

In the Session time-out section of this window, you can select No time-out or Set time-out by clicking the appropriate radio button. If you choose to set the time-out, type the desired value in minutes in the box. 


2. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the Enterprise Application level, navigate to Applications > Enterprise Applications > Your Application > Session Management. 

Check Override in the Override Session Management section, then select to set the time-out and the time-out value. This sets the application session to overwrite those values set at the parent, which in this case is the Server level. 


3. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the Web Application level, navigate to Applications > Enterprise Applications > Your Application > Web Module > Your Web App.war > Session Management. 

Check Override in the Override Session Management section, then select to set the time-out and the time-out value. This sets the Application Session to overwrite those values set at the parent levels, which in this case is the Server or Enterprise Application level. 

After modifying these settings, save the master configuration. 

Setting HTTP Session time-out when application is packaged 

The application developer can also select to set the HTTP Session time-out parameter when the application is packaged. This value is stored in the web.xml file for the Web application. 

This setting overrides any session time-outs defined from the Administrative Console. Alter this setting by repackaging the application with a new value, or by modifying the web.xml file. The entry in the web.xml will be as follows: 
          <session-config> 
      *          <session-timeout>60</session-timeout>
 * 
 *       </session-config>

 

Where the "session-timeout" is an integer value for the desired session time-out in minutes. 
Setting HTTP Session time-out from the application code 

Finally, the HTTP Session time-out can be set in the application code. The programmer can invoke the setMaxInactiveInterval() method on HttpSession object to set the time-out value as desired. This setting overrides any time-out defined in the application package or made from the Administrative Console. 

HTTP Session time-out Override Precedence Summary 

The list below shows the precedence from which the final HTTP Session time-out is derived. 

1. Server Level [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21163875&amp;aid=1] Lowest level 2. Enterprise Application [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21163875&amp;aid=1] Overrides the Server Level if Override is selected 3. Web Application [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21163875&amp;aid=1] Overrides the Server and Enterprise Application settings if Override is selected 4. Application Level (web.xml) [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21163875&amp;aid=1] Overrides Server, Enterprise Application, and Web Application settings 5. Application Code [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21163875&amp;aid=1] Overrides all other settings RELATED INFORMATION

 IBM Is using a monitored JBoss Application Server with ITCAM for J2EE supported in a Windows service? - United States J2EE JBoss server Windows service LA2 fix TECHNOTE (FAQ)

THIS DOCUMENT APPLIES ONLY TO THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGE VERSION(S):
 US English 

QUESTION
 Is using a monitored JBoss Application Server with ITCAM for J2EE supported in a Windows service? 

ANSWER
When you configure the JBoss Application Service to run as a Windows service, you will download the JBoss native connectors [http://jbossweb.jboss.org/downloads/jboss-native-2-0-10] and modify the service.bat file. 

The JBoss service is not available to run as a Windows service when configured with the ITCAM for J2EE agent/DC because this involves changes to the JBoss native connector files and this is currently not supported. Additionally, there's no option to specify the Service name when configuring the JBoss server during the configuration steps. 

If you are using JBoss AS 7.1 or JBoss EAP 6.1.0 or 6.2.0 or 6.3.0, then you will need the to use the latest patch first, [https://developer.ibm.com/answers/questions/208313/how-do-i-download-the-new-itcam-for-j2ee-711-la-if.html]then run the standalone.bat (or domain.bat) program from the command-line after successful configuration. 

Note: If you have a Tomcat server, then you will be able to use that server in a Service, the technote is here. [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21961542]

 IBM Switching Business Process Choreographer Explorer back to using HTTP from HTTPS - United States  DOWNLOADABLE FILES

ABSTRACT
 In Business Process Manager Advanced Version 8.0.1, the default protocol used by Business Process Choreographer Explorer was changed to use HTTPS. You can switch it back to HTTP. 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
When Business Process Choreographer Explorer uses the default secure HTTPS protocol, any attempts to access Business Process Choreographer Explorer using HTTP are redirected to use HTTPS. If you need Business Process Choreographer Explorer to support insecure HTTP connections, you can use the unsecureExplorer.ant script to switch the protocol used from HTTPS to HTTP. 

Attention: It is not recommend to use the insecure HTTP protocol. Using HTTP for the Business Process Choreographer Explorer can open your organization to possible security problems.

Switching to HTTP

If you need to switch Business Process Choreographer Explorer from HTTPS to use HTTP, complete the following actions: 

 1. Download the unsecureExplorer.ant script file, which is attached near the bottom of this page.
    
    
 2. If you previously switched Business Process Choreographer Explorer to use HTTP, but are performing this task again because you are installing an interim fix, fix pack, or refresh pack that updated Business Process Choreographer Explorer has reverted it back to the default HTTPS protocol, you must first delete the old (invalid) backup EAR file before running the script.
    
     * On Linux, UNIX-based and z/OS platforms, delete the install_root/ProcessChoreographer/internal/bpcexplorer_secure_backup.ear file. 
     * On Microsoft Windows platforms, delete the
       install_root\ProcessChoreographer\internal\bpcexplorer_secure_backup.ear file.
       
       
    
    
 3. Run the script to patch the bpcexplorer.ear file. In a network deployment environment, you must run the script on the deployment manager.  * On Linux, UNIX-based and z/OS platforms, enter the following command:
       install_root/ws_ant.sh -f unsecureExplorer.ant 
     * On Windows platforms, enter the following command:
       install_root\ws_ant.bat -f unsecureExplorer.ant
       Note: A backup copy of the original EAR file is created named bpcexplorer_secure_backup.ear.
       
       
    
    
 4. Deploy the patched bpcexplorer.ear file by updating the profile. For more information about updating profiles for an interim fix, see one of the following documents:  * For version 8.0.1.x: Profile update instructions for IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) interim fixes [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21608414]. 
     * For version 8.5 and later: Profile update instructions for IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) interim fixes [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21637449].
       
       
    
    

Remember: In the future, if you install an interim fix, fix pack, or refresh pack that updates the Business Process Choreographer Explorer, it will revert to using the default secure HTTPS protocol. If that happens and you still need the Business Process Choreographer Explorer to use the HTTP protocol, you must complete these steps again to re-enable the HTTP protocol. 



Switching back to HTTPS 

If you need to switch Business Process Choreographer Explorer back from HTTP to HTTPS, complete the following actions:  1. Change to the directory where the backup EAR file is located.  * On Linux, UNIX-based and z/OS platforms, its location is 
       install_root/ProcessChoreographer/internal 
     * On Windows platforms, its location is 
       install_root\ProcessChoreographer\internal
       
       
    
    
 2. In that directory, copy or rename the backup EAR file bpcexplorer_secure_backup.ear to bpcexplorer.ear and overwrite any existing copy.
    
    
 3. Deploy the original HTTPS version by updating the profile. For more information about updating profiles for an interim fix, see one of the following documents:  * For versions 8.0.1.x: Profile update instructions for IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) interim fixes [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21608414]. 
     * For version 8.5 and later: Profile update instructions for IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) interim fixes [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21637449].

 IBM Using WASServiceCmd to create Windows services for WebSphere Application Servers - United States wasservice; was service; wasservice command; websphere windows service; wasservice cmd; versiongap TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 WASServiceCmd.exe is a front end for WASService.exe, which is shipped with WebSphere Application Server. WASService.exe is required in its default directory for adding, updating, and removing WebSphere Services in Windows.

Notice: In WebSphere Application Server v8 and later, this utility is shipped with the product under the name of WASServiceHelper.bat in the bin directory.
Reference:
Using the WASServiceHelper utility to create Windows services for application servers
https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/ae/tins_wasservicecmd.html [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/ae/tins_wasservicecmd.html]

See DeveloperWorks article for detailed information: (Link at the bottom of this document) 

SYMPTOM
Creating and removing a WebSphere service in Windows is confusing and error prone.


CAUSE
This application takes several parameters which can be confusing to the user along with several long path strings leaving opportunities to setup incorrectly.

ENVIRONMENT
Windows

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM



 1. Place the WASServiceCmd.exe utility in the following directory:
    
    install_root\bin 
    
 2. Launch the command from the command line. 
    
    
 3. The WASServiceCmd utility prompts you to select specific options and settings from a list and then calls the WASService.exe command passing all selected parameters. This greatly reduces the time it takes to create a Windows service for WebSphere Application Server and reduces the opportunity for user errors.


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21397335&amp;aid=1] Flash demonstration [http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/websphere/appserv/support/tutorials/wasservicecmd.swf] 

Note: This also creates an entry in the WASServiceCmd.log in the current directory which contains the actual WASService.exe command used to create the service. 

Example of a log entry: 

[Fri Aug 14 12:22:01 -0500 2009] WASService.exe -add "Deployment Mgr01" -serverName "dmgr" 
-profilePath "C:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\Dmgr01"
-logRoot "C:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\Dmgr01\logs\dmgr"
-logFile "C:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\Dmgr01\logs\dmgr\WS_startdmgr.log" -encodeParams -stopArgs "-username vanno -password ****** " 
-startType manual 
-restart false WASServicecmd.zip [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21397335&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21397335&aid=2] 

Notice: Some browsers are having trouble downloading this file and getting docview.wss instead. Download this file, then rename the file with a ".zip" extension (for example, docview.zip or WASServiceCmd.zip). You can now access the utility.

See TroubleShooting: WebSphere Application Server (Windows Services) problems for V6.0, V6.1 and V7.0 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21232884] if you are still having a problem with Windows services. 

 IBM EJB WIMServiceHome cannot be found even after .ear file is installed successfully - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
The ConfigEngine wp-add-property fails with the following error:

Cannot find EJB: ejb/com/ibm/websphere/wim/ejb/WIMServiceHome
[wplc-add-property] javax.naming.ServiceUnavailableException: A communication failure occurred while attempting to obtain an initial context with the provider URL: "corbaloc:iiop:<host name>:<port number>". 


CAUSE
In a cluster, the .ear file must be installed on the Deployment Manager (DMGR). For more information, refer to Document #1358381 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=899&uid=swg21358381]. If originally installed elsewhere, subsequent attempts to install it on the DMGR will appear to succeed but attempts to add properties (ConfigEngine task, wp-add-property) continue to fail with a "Cannot find EJB" message similar to the one above.

ENVIRONMENT
Clustered WebSphere Portal

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
 

-- Confirm that any bootstrap address information in the URL is correct and that the target name server is running. A bootstrap address with no port specification defaults to port 2809. Possible causes other than an incorrect bootstrap address or unavailable name server include the network environment and workstation network configuration.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You must first uninstall the WIMSYSTEM enterprise application from the WebSphere_Portal server (using the WebSphere Administrative console). Then follow the steps in Document #1358381 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=899&uid=swg21358381] to install the .ear file on the DMGR.

 IBM Finding if Table created as NOT LOGGED INITIALLY - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How to find if Table was Created as NOT LOGGED INITIALLY? 

ANSWER
We can use either of the following methods to Check if Table was created as 'Not Logged Initially'
1)Using db2cat,

db2cat -db <dbname> -n <TableName> -s <Schema> -t | grep "Table not logged"
Which can confirm if given table was created as NLI or not.

Sample Output 
----------------------
Connecting to the Database.
Connect to Database Successful.
Table not logged : 0
----------------------
Table not Logged showing '0' represent Table was not created as NLI, if it returns '1' then that is table was created as NLI.

2)Using db2look 
Using db2look command to get DDL information on the table which would show you if 
the table was created as "NOT LOGGED INITIALLY" 

Example: 
db2look -d <database_name> -t <table_name> -e -o <output_file_name.out> 

NOTE: Table Alter with ACTIVATE NOT LOGGED INITIALLY will not be listed in these above commands as it will activate NLI only for current Unit of work.

NOTE:In DB2 V8 the LOG_ATTRIBUTE column in the SYSCAT.TABLES table was used to 
check if a table was created as NOT LOGGED INITIALLY.
But Starting from DB2 V9 this column is no longer being used and will always have a value of 0.

 IBM DataPower off-device logging: a configuration example - United States datapower; 7993; machine type 7993; logging; off device; off device logging; log target; off-device; syslog; debug log level; debug; log level TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote gives an example of how to enable off-device logging on an IBM® WebSphere® DataPower® appliance. This can be very helpful when a debug log level is needed to help isolate a problem or monitor behavior over a long period of time or can be used in production environment as DataPower only keeps a limited number of log files (the default is 3 files) in the file system in a rotational basis. 

CAUSE
The DataPower device has a finite amount of space to hold larger than average log files or long term logging needs in production environment. 

It should be noted that if used while debugging at load or in a capacity issue, log events may be dropped. There is a prioritization of events within the device and client traffic always comes first. Log events dropped can be confirmed or counted from the Status>Log Targets menu in the WebGUI.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Configure a server daemon to listen and capture the DataPower devices events. First, this example shows how to create the log target sending events to a syslog destination. The other examples listed below will have their own strong points to be considered depending on the problem scenario. 

 

Syslog: 

* The syslog protocol operates over UDP which has no guarantee on packet delivery - a fast fire and forget method. 

To create the new log target, go into the default domain: Objects > Log Targets 

Configure the log target with settings as follows from the WebGUI: 

 1. Name the log target 
 2. Select Target Type of syslog 
 3. Fill in the Local Identifier with a descriptive string that may be used by a remote recipient to identify this specific log target 
 4. Enter the Remote Host Address and the Remote IP Port as in the screen shot wherex.x.x.x is the IP address of the remote syslog server that listens on port 514 
 5. Take all other defaults



[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=1]  

 

Under the Event Subscriptions tab, you can select all and debug as indicated here: 


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=2] 

 * 
 * 6. Generate log events in the DataPower by using some transactions, for example by saving the configuration from the WebGUI or running some test load into a domain.


Syslog-ng, will simply work over the TCP protocol to ensure the packet is delivered to the destination. The same consideration should be applied to a device under high load in that a log event could be dropped if not able to be wrote out to the network within time. 

 

NFS:
All NFS limitations apply from file size and permission settings. This is a more common approach using an NFS static mount to capture a log target and can allow for slightly more reliable messages to be logged. The limiting factor again is the speed of the network and NFS server response time. 

 

File type: 

Using a file type log target with a backup method as seen here:
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=3]
This will allow log events to quickly be written to a local file on the device's file system. Once the file reaches its set size a connection to the destination will upload the file from the device. This will upload with a unique time and date stamp on the uploaded file.

This is a useful method to capture sporadic problems. This is also useful for long running transactions that may span more than one file depending on device load.


HTTP service:
Finally a clever method that may be used in some senarios would be an HTTP service on the device.
Using an HTTP service configured in the following way,
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=4] 

Once the file type log is created in the logtemp:/// directory, a client browser or wget type client can easily retrieve the file from the device. 

This is very useful when there is no local or accessible remote log storage location to the device, due to firewall or network restrictions. 

This is also removing the limitation of the device dropping the log event should it not be able to write the log event to the network. 

Each of the above methods are very useful and work better in some scenarios than others depending on the network, load, problem, and information needed. This is intended to be a guide to help you decide which method would be best for your scenario. 

 IBM Remote scanning freezes or stops with IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture - United States hang scan ie8 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Remote scanning using scanner freezes or stops when using Internet Explorer 8 or later. 

SYMPTOM
Additional symptoms include: 

 * The web page may crash and recover (close and quickly reopen). 
 * The freeze may occur during or after scanning the first page.


CAUSE
Internet Explorer (IE) 8 and later includes its own version of Data Execution Prevention (DEP) which can cause the above symptoms and prevent scanning from running.

ENVIRONMENT
Internet Explorer 8 and later



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To disable DEP: 

 1. In the browser, open the Tools menu, and select Internet Options. 
 2. Select the Advanced tab. 
 3. Uncheck Enable memory protection to mitigate online attacks. 
 4. Close all windows, restart the browser and start scanning again.


Note: If using Datacap 8.1, this issue has been fixed in 8.1 Fix Pack 1. 

 IBM The import task failed with "INFO: Upload replication check failed with error: getservbyname_r failed (Java::JavaLang::RuntimeException)" after patching BigFix/ILMT RedHat Linux server. - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 The import task failed with "INFO: Upload replication check failed with error: getservbyname_r failed (Java::JavaLang::RuntimeException)" after patching BigFix/ILMT RedHat Linux server. 

CAUSE
TEMA version: 9.2.2.0-20151209-1636
After patching BigFix/ILMT Redhat Linux server, the import task started to fail with the following error in the import log:

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22004607&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22004607&aid=1]

The $PATH environment variable shows:


echo $PATH 

/usr/lib64/qt-3.3/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/root/bin 

Even re-installing the glibc 32-bit library rpm package again and rebooting the RedHat server as well, it won't resolve the issue.

Note: same error will occur when modifying the datasource setting as well as described in the above technote link.


ANSWER
The problem is resolved after upgrading to ILMT 9.2.7 and the import task continues to work successfully. Most likely this is due to the ILMT 9.2.2 application expecting a specific version of glibc 32-bit library file and it won't work if a newer version is found after the patching the RedHat Linux server.

==================
The following problems are addressed by this fix.

2.1 APARs:
----------

N/A 

2.2 Defects
--------------

Defect: 61583
Abstract: Increase java heap size and thread pool size.
Additional Information: In order to support monitoring more DPs per instance, we increased the maximum heap size from 512M to 1024M. And the thread pool size is changed from 5 to 10.

To enable the new maximum heap size, agent need to be restarted.

To enable the new thread pool size:
1. Re-config the instances.
2. Modify the agent's config file and restart the agent instances.
--For UNIX/LINUX
Modify the file "bn_<instanceName>.config", change the item "CDP_DP_THREAD_POOL_SIZE" to "10".
--For Windows
Modify the file "KBNENV_<instanceName>", change the item "CDP_DP_THREAD_POOL_SIZE" to "10".

5.1 Before installing the fix
-----------------------------
- The prerequisites listed under section 3.1 entitled 'Upgrade prerequisites 
for this fix' must be installed when upgrading.

- For the purpose of this README, the <CANDLEHOME> symbol is the 
IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory. The default value
for CANDLEHOME is '/opt/IBM/ITM' on UNIX systems and 'C:\ibm\itm'
on Windows systems.

- If you customize the Extended Monitoring Agent for WebSphere DataPower Appliance 
bn.ini file on a UNIX system, back up this file before installing the fix. 
After this fix is installed, edit the latest bn.ini file and merge 
your modifications into this bn.ini file.


5.2 Local agent install and update (including silent installation)
--------------------------------------------------------------
1. Transfer the appropriate archive file to a 
temporary directory on the system that contains the agent code to be 
updated. For the purpose of this README, the <TEMP> symbol represents 
the fully qualified path to this directory.
Note: On Windows systems, this path includes the drive letter. 

2. Expand the archive file by using the tar command on UNIX systems or 
an unzip utility on Windows systems. This expansion creates a directory 
structure that contains fixes for all supported platforms.

3. Use the procedures in the "IBM Tivoli Monitoring, Version 6.3 FP3
Installation and Setup Guide" to install the agent.

4. Use the procedures in the specific monitoring agent user's
guide to complete the installation and configuration.


5.3 Remote agent update and installation
----------------------------------------
1. Make sure that all potential targets of the remote deployment are
running version 6.2.3 Fix Pack 4 or later of the OS monitoring 
agent.
2. Transfer the appropriate archive file to 
a temporary directory on the Tivoli Enterprise 
Monitoring Server system. For the purpose of this README, the 
<TEMP> symbol represents the fully qualified path to this directory.
Note: On Windows systems, this path includes the drive letter. 

3. Expand the archive file by using the tar command on UNIX systems or an 
unzip utility on Windows systems. This expansion creates a directory structure
that contains fixes for all supported operating systems.

4. To add the fix pack bundles to the remote deployment depot, use the
tacmd addBundles command found in $CANDLEHOME/bin on UNIX systems
or in %CANDLE_HOME%\bin on Windows systems. For more information
about the tacmd addBundles command, see the "IBM Tivoli
Monitoring Command Reference."

On a UNIX system: if the fix was expanded to 
<TEMP>/<PARTNUMBER>:
> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>/<PARTNUMBER>/WINDOWS/Deploy -t bn -f
> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>/<PARTNUMBER>/unix -t bn -f 

where:
-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to be
added to the depot.
-t is the product code of the product to add, for example, bn 
represents the Extended Monitoring Agent for WebSphere DataPower Appliance
-f shows that the actions are complete and confirmation is not requested

On a Windows system: if the fix was expanded to 
<TEMP>/<PARTNUMBER>:
> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>\<PARTNUMBER>\WINDOWS\Deploy -t bn -f
> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>\<PARTNUMBER>\unix -t bn -f 

where:
-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to be
added to the depot. 
-t is the product code of the product to add, for example, bn 
represents the Extended Monitoring Agent for WebSphere DataPower Appliance
-f shows that the actions are complete and confirmation is not requested

5. To login to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring server and deploy
the fix to the appropriate nodes where the agent is running, use
the following tacmd commands. For more information about the
tacmd login and updateAgent commands, see the "IBM Tivoli
Monitoring Command Reference."

On a UNIX system: 
> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>
-u <itmuser> 
-p <password>

> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems

The output shows the managed system name for the OS agent on the 
remote system to be installed/update. Use this value as the target of the
tacmd addsystem/updateAgent command. 

> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd addsystem -t bn 
-n <Managed system name>
-p <Configration Info>

> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd updateAgent -t bn
-n <Managed system name>
-v 071003000

On a Windows system:
> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd login -s <server>
-u <itmuser> 
-p <password>

> %CANDLE_HOME%/bin/tacmd listSystems

The output shows the managed system name for the OS agent on the 
remote system to be installed/updated. Use this value as the target of the
tacmd addsystem/updateAgent command. 

> $CANDLEHOME%\bin\tacmd addsystem -t BN 
-n <Managed system name>
-p <Configration Info>

> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd updateAgent -t BN
-n <Managed system name>
-v 071003000
Note:
- The component (-t) for the updateAgent command is specified as 
two characters (bn), not three characters (kbn).
- The node (-n) for the updateAgent command is the managed system
name of the operating system (OS) agent to be updated. The 
target node for an updateAgent command is always an OS agent.
- The component (-p) for the addsystem command is for agent's configuration info.
Here is an example:
INSTANCE="value"
KQZ_SNMPEVENT.KQZ_SNMPEVENT_PORT="162"
KQZ_SNMPEVENT.KQZ_SNMPEVENT_SECURITY_LEVEL="authPriv"
KQZ_SNMPEVENT.KQZ_SNMPEVENT_USER_NAME="admin"
KQZ_SNMPEVENT.KQZ_SNMPEVENT_AUTH_PROTOCOL="SHA"
KQZ_SNMPEVENT.KQZ_SNMPEVENT_AUTH_PASSWORD="value"
KQZ_SNMPEVENT.KQZ_SNMPEVENT_PRIV_PROTOCOL="DES"
KQZ_SNMPEVENT.KQZ_SNMPEVENT_PRIV_PASSWORD="value"
DPS:<Managed_System_Name>.SOAP_HOST="value"
DPS:<Managed_System_Name>.DP_PORT="5550"
DPS:<Managed_System_Name>.DP_UID="admin"
DPS:<Managed_System_Name>.DP_PASSWORD="value"

DPC:<Managed_System_Name>.SNMP_HOST="value"
DPC:<Managed_System_Name>.SNMP_PORT="161"
DPC:<Managed_System_Name>.SNMP_COMMUNITY="public" 

- The following error might occur with the updateAgent command on 
Linux and UNIX endpoints; however, the agent is successfully 
updated. This error does not occur on Windows endpoints.

KUICUA011I: Updating the bn agents.
KUICUA015E: The updateAgent command did not complete because an
error occurred. Refer to the following error
returned from the server:

The monitoring server encountered an error while updating the
managed system type.

The kuiras1.log file might provide more information about 
this error. If you require further assistance to resolve the 
error, contact IBM Software Support.

A timeout occurred while waiting for an agent task to complete on
{node name}.

The agent task did not complete within the configured 
time out period.

Verify that the target system is online. Increase the 
time out value and try the operation again.



5.4 Agent support update
------------------------
Fix 7.1.0-TIV-ITM_WDP-FP0003 included changes to the agent
support files that must be installed. If you installed these updates already, there are no additional installation
steps. Otherwise, use the following steps to update the Tivoli
Enterprise Monitoring Server, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, or
Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop.

1. Transfer the appropriate archive file 
to the IBM Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Servers, IBM Tivoli
Enterprise Portal Servers, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal desktops. 

2. Expand the archive file by using the tar command on UNIX systems or an 
unzip utility on Windows systems. 

3. Use the procedures in the "IBM Tivoli Monitoring, Version 6.3 FP3
Installation and Setup Guide."

4. Use the procedures in the specific monitoring agent user's
guide to complete the installation and configuration.

5. If the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server that is updated is remote (not a 
Hub Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server) then restart the Tivoli Enterprise 
Monitoring Server.



6.0 Additional installation information
========================
6.1 Installation instructions for agent baroc file
-----------------------------------------------------
There are no updates to the baroc files included in this fix or
any of the superseded fixes. No additional installation steps are
required.

6.2 Additional information on new configuration item "KBN_SOMA_PROTOCOL"
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A new configuration item "KBN_SOMA_PROTOCOL" is introduced to support TLS.
The value should be SSL/TLSv1/TLSv1.1/TLSv1.2. The default value is "TLSv1". 
If you want to support TLSv1.1/TLSv1.2, please change it manually.

1. For Windows platform:
The new item "KBN_SOMA_PROTOCOL" is in KBNENV and KBNENV_<instanceName>.

a. Agent instance must be restarted to enable the new configuration change.
b. The vaule of "KBN_SOMA_PROTOCOL" in KBNENV_<instanceName> will be updated to 
the same vaule of "KBN_SOMA_PROTOCOL" in KBNENV while the instance is re-configured.

2. For Linux/Unix platform:
The new items "KBN_SOMA_PROTOCOL" is in bn.ini and bn_<instanceName>.config.

a. Agent instance must be restarted to enable the new configuration change.
b. The vaule of "KBN_SOMA_PROTOCOL" in bn_<instanceName>.config will be updated to 
the same vaule of "KBN_SOMA_PROTOCOL" in bn.ini while the instance is re-configured.

6.3 Verifying the update
----------------------------
1. To verify that the agent was updated correctly, use the tacmd command
to view the current version of the agent after the agent is restarted.
You are required to log in to a Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring
Server before viewing the agent version.

For example:
On UNIX systems, where $CANDLEHOME is the IBM Tivoli Monitoring
installation directory, the default location is '/opt/IBM/ITM'.

> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>
-u <itmuser>
-p <password>
> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems -t or

On Windows systems, where %CANDLE_HOME% is the IBM Tivoli
Monitoring installation directory, the default location
is 'C:\IBM\ITM'.

> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd login -s <server>
-u <itmuser>
-p <password>
> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd listSystems -t bn

Note: The component (-t) for the tacmd listSystems command is
specified as two characters (bn), not three characters (kbn).

When the agent update is successful, the agent version is:
07.10.03.00

After the agent is restarted, you can also use the GUI to verify
that the agent was successfully updated.

For the agent on Windows systems, the version number is
07.10.03.00.
For the agent on UNIX systems, the version number is
07.10.03.00.

2. To verify that the agent support files were updated correctly, use the
kincinfo command on Windows systems or the cinfo command on
Linux or UNIX systems. The sample output below shows the versions
of the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, Tivoli Enterprise
Monitoring Server, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop systems
after this fix has been successfully applied.

Note: The date shown for the build might not be accurate. This
is a known problem.

 IBM Developer for z Systems and Rational Developer for z Systems Backward/Forward compatibility - United States RDz; compatible; backward; forward; IDz; Debug Tool: Debugger TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What levels of the IBM Developer for z Systems and Rational Developer for z Systems host and client are compatible? 

ANSWER
Client/Server Compatibility



In general, IBM Developer for z Systems, Rational Developer for z Systems and Rational Developer for System z follow a two level backward and forward compatibility tolerance for basic Client /Server functionality. 

IBM Developer for z Systems v14.1.x host/client is compatible with IBM Developer for z Systems v14.1.x client/host, IBM Developer for z Systems v14.0.x client/host and Rational Developer for z Systems v9.5.x client/host. 

IBM Developer for z Systems v14.0.x host/client is compatible with IBM Developer for z Systems v14.1.x client/host, IBM Developer for z Systems v14.0.x client/host, Rational Developer for z Systems v9.5.x client/host and Rational Developer for System z v9.1.x client/host. 

Rational Developer for z Systems v9.5.x host/client is compatible with IBM Developer for z Systems v14.1.x client/host, IBM Developer for z Systems v14.0.x client/host, Rational Developer for z Systems v9.5.x client/host and Rational Developer for System z v9.1.x, and v9.0.x client/host. 

Rational Developer for System z v9.1.x host/client is compatible with IBM Developer for z Systems v14.0.x client/host, Rational Developer for z Systems v9.5.x client/host and Rational Developer for System z v9.1, v9.0.x, and v8.5.x client/host. 

Rational Developer for System z v9.0.x host/client is compatible with versions v9.5.x, v9.1.x, v9.0.x, v8.5.x and v8.0.x client/host. 

Rational Developer for System z v8.5.x host/client is compatible with versions v9.1, v9.0, v8.5, v8.0.x, and v7.6.x client/host. 

Basic Client/Server functionality includes: 
• Connecting to a z/OS System 
• Allocating z/OS Data sets 
• Creating a z/OS Project 
• Working with z/OS COBOL & Pl/I remote assets – edit, syntax check, submit, execute, debug and view the output 
• Basic CARMA functionality 
• Compatibility between service levels within a release is also supported (for example, using the v9.5 client to access a v9.5.1 server). 

As an example, if you upgrade your Developer for z Systems host to 14.0.x, client versions v9.1.x, v9.5.x, v14.0 and v14.1.x are compatible with the 14.0.x server. 

Likewise, if you upgrade your Developer for z Systems client to 14.0.x, server versions v9.1.x, v9.5.x, v14.0.x and v14.1.x are compatible with the 14.0.x client. 

Note: Server enhancements that are client-dependent are not available to developers using earlier versions of the client. 

Client enhancements that are server-dependent are not available to developers accessing earlier versions of the server.

 IBM Reducing the size of Decision Warehouse trace when running scenario suites - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 When running a Decision Validation Service scenario suite in Rule Team Server can the optional trace be filtered to reduce its size ? 

ANSWER
It is possible to customize the Decision Warehouse (DW) trace that is used by the Scenario Suite Provider (SSP) when a Decision Validation Service (DVS) scenario suite is executed in Rule Team Server. The customization can filter out information that is not necessary to keep in the DW. A sample implementation is provided that removes information about all the rules that are not fired, which helps keep the size of the trace small when there is a large number of rules in the ruleset and typically a much smaller number of rules actually fire. Also, only the DW persisted trace is smaller, the original larger trace is still used by DVS to perform the tests involved in the scenario suite. 

Instructions: 

 1. Unjar the attached jrules-ssptrace-src.jar to a local directory 
 2. Edit the file ./jrules-ssptrace/build.xml and modify the properties to reflect your environment setup ( in particular the jrules.home directory path, the sspInput and sspOutput file paths ) 
 3. Using a command line from the directory ./jrules-ssptrace execute: ant repackage-ssp 
 4. Deploy the customized SSP (available as the sspOutput file path)

 IBM Wrap table column text in list tab - United States TPAEICD; wrap; table; col; length; line; feed TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How to wrap table column text in list tab? 

ANSWER
You can wrap table column text according to number of characters by using property wraplength in the tablecol tag e.g.

<tablecol dataattribute="description" id="results_showlist_tablebody_3" sortable="false" width="200" wraplength="100"/>

This will wrap the text once it reaches 100 characters into a new line.

 IBM Locating ITM Workspace Application Support Files for z/OS Agents - United States AppSupport OMEGAMON application support 350 360 410 420 610 601 700 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote addresses the commonly asked question of where can workspace application support files be found for z/OS Agents. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Before you can view data collected by monitoring agents, you must install application support for the agents on the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server and on the hub Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server. When you install application support on the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, you are installing the files required for presenting workspaces and online help for each monitoring agent. When you install application support on the hub monitoring server, you are installing the files required for product-provided situations, situation distributions, and other product-specific data. Installing application support on the hub monitoring server is also known as "seeding" the hub.
Most z/OS-based agents provide application support files on CDs or DVDs, which are separate from the mainframe installation media. Distributed agents include their application support files in the distributed installation process. Each CD /DVD that contains application support files is listed below, with information about which products use the CD /DVD and where the CD / DVD can be found. The latest level in fulfillment is the CD /DVD on this list. Where possible, IBM provides both .zip and .tar formats, as well as .iso format, so that a physical CD / DVD can be created.

Please note that the IBM Tivoli Monitoring (ITM) media is separate from the workspace application support files which are included with products that run in the ITM environment. ITM can be obtained by ordering either 5724-C04 IBM Tivoli Monitoring through Passport Advantage or the no charge 5698-A79 IBM Tivoli Management Services on z/OS through Shop zSeries. Your IBM rep can ask Techline to configure and submit the order as well. 5698-A79 includes the server, engine, and configurator on z/OS. Workspace application support files may have their own fixpacks which are separate and distinct from any ITM fixpacks. Fixpacks can be found on the product support urls at: 
http://www-306.ibm.com/software/support/index_A_Z.html [http://www-306.ibm.com/software/support/index_A_Z.html].

The ITM Configuration Guide describes the application support installation process. It can be found online in the ITM information center at: https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSTFXA_6.3.0/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3/install/agent_support.htm [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSTFXA_6.3.0/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3/install/agent_support.htm].

Note: if you are running one of the V3.1.0 OMEGAMONs with the V360 level of platform and not the ITM level, you will need to use CD number LCD7-0764-02 [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/tivoli_support/misc/PandA/tools_agent/tools/appsupt/LCD7-0764-02.zip]. If you are running the V350 level of platform, which was packaged with the legacy level of products, the CDs contain both platform and product so are not available on a general access url. The current CD levels are LCD7-0617-02 for Windows and LCD7-0618-02 for Unix. If you do not find these CDs in your product package, contact IBM Software Support or your IBM sales representative to get replacement media.

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This DB2 SQL error occurs with Sterling B2B Integrator: SQLCODE: -1585, SQLSTATE: 54048 

SYMPTOM
com.sterlingcommerce.woodstock.profile.ProfileFinderException: listAllByEntityName: Finder Exception occurred: 

SQLState: 54048
Message: DB2 SQL error: SQLCODE: -1585, SQLSTATE: 54048, SQLERRMC: null
Vendor: -1585


CAUSE
The DB2 instance did not have all 4 sizes of Temp tablespace defined.
DBA had manually created the Temp tablespaces but only the 8k and 32k size.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The DB2 instance must have all 4 sizes of Temp tablespace created: 4k, 8k, 16k, and 32k. 

In addition, these must be set as System Temp tablespaces, and not as User Temp tablespaces.

 IBM What are the analyzer.db.updateMode parameter values for Case Foundation Case Analyzer? - United States performance TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What are the analyzer.db.updateMode parameter values for Case Foundation Case Analyzer? 

ANSWER
The analyzer.db.updateMode parameter controls the JDBC update method used by Case Analyzer when updating tables in the Case Analyzer store SQL database. 

The default value is CUSTOM_BATCH. That means that the JDBC driver will use the CUSTOM_BATCH update method for Case Analyzer queries. 

Another possible value is BATCH. That means that the JDBC driver will use the BATCH update method for Case Analyzer queries. 

You can set the BATCH value for the analyzer.db.updateMode parameter with the following query in the Case Analyzer store database: 

 

 * UPDATE X_CAProperties SET PropValue='BATCH' 
   WHERE PropName ='analyzer.db.updateMode' 


When to set the analyzer.db.updateMode = BATCH setting 
 * IBM support may ask customer to set this setting to circumvent various performance-related symptoms and unexpected behavior. 
 * In general, our experience is that the Microsoft JDBC drivers work better and are more stable with the analyzer.db.updateMode = BATCH setting.

$ db2 backup db sample
SQL1035N The operation failed because the specified database cannot be
connected to in the mode requested. SQLSTATE=57019

* The backup command failed. But this error does not happen on V9.7. 

For avoiding the error in offline-backup, use quiesce instance command with restricted access option.



CAUSE
Because of the code change in V10.1 GA, the off-line backup command could be blocked for short period of time while connect database command is executed.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

Please use quiesce instance command with the "restricted access" option instead of the quiesce database command. 

Or please retry off-line backup command after getting SQL1035N error.

 IBM Steps to disable RC4 SSL ciphers in Tivoli Integrated Portal - United States TIPL2SSL; TIPL2; TIPL2CONF; RC4; cipher; SSL TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What are the steps to disable RC4 ciphers from TIP? 

CAUSE
Security scans may suggest disabling RC4 ciphers

ANSWER
To remove RC4 ciphers:


 1. Log into the Websphere Application server and navigate to:
    SSL certificate and key management > SSL configurations > NodeDefaultSSLSettings > Quality of protection (QoP)
    
    
 2. Select the *RC4* ciphers from the "Selected ciphers" list, and then click the "<<Remove" button.
    
    
 3.  Click the "Apply" button, and then the "Save (to the master configuration)" link.
    
    
 4. Restart TIP. 

 IBM MQ 7.1 and later: How to remove a channel authentication record (CHLAUTH) - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 You have added a channel authentication record into a WebSphere MQ 7.1 or later queue manager:

SET CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER(testuser) USERSRC(CHANNEL) ACTION(ADD)
AMQ8877: WebSphere MQ channel authentication record set.

Then you display it:

DISPLAY CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP)
1 : DISPLAY CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP)
AMQ8878: Display channel authentication record details.
CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP)
CLNTUSER(testuser) USERSRC(CHANNEL)

Now you want to remove it and you try executing the following runmqsc command which you constructed using copy and paste from the above output:

DELETE CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER(testuser) USERSRC(CHANNEL)
3 : DELETE CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER(testuser) USERSRC(CHANNEL)

You get the following error:

AMQ8405: Syntax error detected at or near end of command segment below:-
DELETE CHLAUTH

The DELETE CHLAUTH does not exist and after consulting the MQ 7.1 Information Center you read that you have to use the SET CHLAUTH command with the argument ACTION(REMOVE). You try now:

SET CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER(testuser) ACTION(REMOVE)
19 : SET CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER(testuser) ACTION(REMOVE)

But you get the following error:

AMQ8884: Channel authentication record not found.

You specified the attribute CLNTUSER(testuser) as it was shown in the output of the DISPLAY CHLAUTH(*), thus, you think the record should be found. You want to know what is the problem?


CAUSE
See the following section of the MQ 7.1 documentation:
WebSphere MQ > Administering > Administering local WebSphere MQ objects > Performing local administration tasks using MQSC commands
WebSphere MQ object names [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_7.1.0/com.ibm.mq.doc/fa11060_.htm]
+ Case-sensitivity in MQSC commands
MQSC commands, including their attributes, can be written in upper-case or lower-case. Object names in MQSC commands are folded to upper-case (that is, QUEUE and queue are not differentiated), unless the names are enclosed within single quotation marks. If quotation marks are not used, the object is processed with a name in upper-case. 

When specifying the SET command with the following value CLNTUSER(testuser) the string 'testuser' will be folded to upper-case resulting in the following value being actually used by runmqsc:
CLNTUSER(TESTUSER)
And in this case, there is no record for the user TESTUSER (the record is for 'testuser').


ANSWER
NOTICE that the userid mentioned in the CLNTUSER field of the output of the DISPLAY CHLAUTH command is NOT surrounded by single quotes. 

However, you MUST include the single quotes when specifying the value during an ACTION(REMOVE):

SET CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('testuser') ACTION(REMOVE)
1 : set CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('testuser') ACTION(REMOVE)
AMQ8877: WebSphere MQ channel authentication record set.


++ Example of record with more attributes

Let's examine the case when a record has more attributes, such as:

SET CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('client_1') USERSRC(MAP) MCAUSER('user_1') ADDRESS('*') ACTION(ADD)
AMQ8877: WebSphere MQ channel authentication record set.

display CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL)
9 : display CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL)
AMQ8878: Display channel authentication record details.
CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP)
DESCR( ) CUSTOM( )
ADDRESS(*) CLNTUSER(client_1)
MCAUSER(user_1) USERSRC(MAP)

You want to delete the record and you try the following command which is based on the command that worked well for a simpler case. But this time, it fails:

SET CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('client_1') ACTION(REMOVE)
AMQ8884: Channel authentication record not found.

You try the original command that created the record, but changing the action to REMOVE:
SET CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('client_1') USERSRC(MAP) MCAUSER('user_1') ADDRESS('*') ACTION(REMOVE)
AMQ8885: Parameter not allowed for this action on a channel authentication record.

The attribute USERSRC is not a valid parameter for the REMOVE action (see table below).
Therefore, by removing this attribute, then the following command worked successfully to remove the record:
SET CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('mengano') ADDRESS('*') ACTION(REMOVE) 
AMQ8877: WebSphere MQ channel authentication record set.

See:
WebSphere MQ 8.0.0 > IBM MQ > Reference > Administration reference > MQSC reference > The MQSC commands >

 IBM SQL1763N error with Reason Code 11 while running "Alter Tablespace" command to reclaim unused storage space against DMS or automatic storage tablespaces. - United States SQL1763N; Alter Tablespace; reclaimable storage; DMS; Automatic storage table spaces; MON_GET_TABLESPACE; RECLAIMABLE_SPACE_ENABLED; SMS; DB2 Version 9.7; lower high water mark TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Receiving SQL1763N error with Reason Code 11 while running "Alter Tablespace" command to reclaim unused storage space against DMS or automatic storage tablespaces. 

SYMPTOM
Following reasons apply: 

 * If the DMS or automatic storage tablespaces are not created in DB2 Version 9.7 or later, as the "Reclaimable Storage" is not available in tablespaces created in earlier versions(V9.1/V9.5) of the DB2 product. 
 * Trying to alter a SMS tablespace as this feature is not supported on SMS tablespaces. 


Example testcase on a TEMPSPACE1 SMS tablespace. 

 * 
 * 
 * DB21034E The command was processed as an SQL statement because it was not a valid Command Line Processor command. During SQL processing it returned: SQL1763N Invalid ALTER TABLESPACE statement for table space "TEMPSPACE1" due to reason "11" SQLSTATE=429BC 
 * 
   


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
MON_GET_TABLESPACE table function and RECLAIMABLE_SPACE_ENABLED monitor element can be used to identify whether the tablespace is enabled for reclaimable storage or not. Example: 
db2 "SELECT varchar(tbsp_name, 30) as tbsp_name, tbsp_type, RECLAIMABLE_SPACE_ENABLED FROM TABLE(MON_GET_TABLESPACE('',-2))" 

 

Snippet of the output: 

 

TBSP_NAME TBSP_TYPE RECLAIMABLE_SPACE_ENABLED
----------------- ----------- -------------------------
SYSCATSPACE DMS 1
TEMPSPACE1 SMS 0
USERSPACE1 DMS 1 

If the RECLAIMABLE_SPACE_ENABLED monitor element returns a value of 1, then the tablespace is enabled for reclaimable storage. Otherwise, it returns a value of 0.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To use the reclaimable storage feature, make sure to create the DMS or automatic storage tablespaces in DB2 Version 9.7 or later. Example testcase on SYSCATSPACE DMS tablespace which has reclaimable storage enabled. 

 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


Note: 
Tablespaces migrated from DB2 V9.1/V9.5 to V9.7 won't get upgraded directly to use the reclaimable storage feature. RELATED INFORMATION

QUESTION
 The Filter Analyzer reports the error:

"rule includes an unsupported expression"

when comparing two ObjectServer fields against each other and/or a field against GetDate within an EventReader Filter



CAUSE
This is a limitation in the functionality of the Filter Analyzer in Impact and can produce the log file message:
WARN [EventFilter] Could not consolidate filters. Please check if the filter expressions are valid. java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException




ANSWER
In the EventReader properties file: 


$NCHOME/impact/etc/[ImpactServerName]_[EventReaderName].props

where [ImpactServerName] is the name of the ImpactServer (NCI by default) and [EventReaderName] is the lower-case name of the EventReader (for example: omnibuseventreader). Add the property:

impact.[EventReaderName].consolidatefilters=false

where, again, [EventReaderName] is the lower-case name of the EventReader (for example: omnibuseventreader).

Once this property has been added to the file an ImpactServer restart is required to enable it.

In a Clustered environment one would have to stop the Secondary ImpactServer(s) first, then stop and restart the Primary ImpactServer and then restart the Secondary ImpactServer(s) to ensure that the property is not overwritten and is distributed to each ImpactServer in the Cluster.

Please note that this issue relates to the use of the Filter Analyzer and does not impinge upon the EventReader ability to parse the Filter.

If you are unable to see the Filter being applied in the outgoing SQL for the EventReader please read the TechNote "EventReader Filters not applied to SQL select statement" [link below].

 IBM Using WASServiceCmd to create Windows services for WebSphere Application Servers - United States wasservice; was service; wasservice command; websphere windows service; wasservice cmd; versiongap TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 WASServiceCmd.exe is a front end for WASService.exe, which is shipped with WebSphere Application Server. WASService.exe is required in its default directory for adding, updating, and removing WebSphere Services in Windows.

Notice: In WebSphere Application Server v8 and later, this utility is shipped with the product under the name of WASServiceHelper.bat in the bin directory.
Reference:
Using the WASServiceHelper utility to create Windows services for application servers
https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/ae/tins_wasservicecmd.html [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/ae/tins_wasservicecmd.html]

See DeveloperWorks article for detailed information: (Link at the bottom of this document) 

SYMPTOM
Creating and removing a WebSphere service in Windows is confusing and error prone.


CAUSE
This application takes several parameters which can be confusing to the user along with several long path strings leaving opportunities to setup incorrectly.

ENVIRONMENT
Windows

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM



 1. Place the WASServiceCmd.exe utility in the following directory:
    
    install_root\bin 
    
 2. Launch the command from the command line. 
    
    
 3. The WASServiceCmd utility prompts you to select specific options and settings from a list and then calls the WASService.exe command passing all selected parameters. This greatly reduces the time it takes to create a Windows service for WebSphere Application Server and reduces the opportunity for user errors.


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21397335&amp;aid=1] Flash demonstration [http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/websphere/appserv/support/tutorials/wasservicecmd.swf] 

Note: This also creates an entry in the WASServiceCmd.log in the current directory which contains the actual WASService.exe command used to create the service. 

Example of a log entry: 

[Fri Aug 14 12:22:01 -0500 2009] WASService.exe -add "Deployment Mgr01" -serverName "dmgr" 
-profilePath "C:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\Dmgr01"
-logRoot "C:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\Dmgr01\logs\dmgr"
-logFile "C:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\Dmgr01\logs\dmgr\WS_startdmgr.log" -encodeParams -stopArgs "-username vanno -password ****** "

-restart false WASServicecmd.zip [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21397335&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21397335&aid=2] 

Notice: Some browsers are having trouble downloading this file and getting docview.wss instead. Download this file, then rename the file with a ".zip" extension (for example, docview.zip or WASServiceCmd.zip). You can now access the utility.

ENVIRONMENT
IBM DB2 database

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Connect to database back end and check the result of this query :-


select propvalue from maximo.maxpropvalue where propname='mxe.db.format.nullvalue'; 

If you are using DB2 database, the result should be 'COALESCE'.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
For IBM DB2, the value is COALESCE, and you cannot change the default value. 

For Oracle, the value is NVL, and you cannot change the default value.
For SQL Server, the value must be set to ISNULL.

Make sure MXServer is stopped. Connect to database back end and update mxe.db.format.nullvalue by running following query :- 

update maximo.maxpropvalue set propvalue='COALESCE' where propname='mxe.db.format.nullvalue'; 

Start MXServer again. 

 IBM What are the supported Apple Macintosh Operating System Versions for IBM SPSS Statistics? - United States SPSS mac macintosh Apple Macintosh statistics OS supported version compatibility matrix leopard Snow Leopard Lion Mountain Lion 10.8 Mavericks 10.9 22 Yosemite 10.10 (Yosemite) el capitan 10.11 spss 24 Sierra 10.12 High Sierra 10.13 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I would like to know what are the supported Macintosh Operating system versions for IBM SPSS Statistics versions? 

ANSWER
Please see the list below. It is strongly recommended to review the platform information on IBM Software Product Compatibility Reports [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/prodguid/v1r0/clarity/index.jsp]. The installation of IBM SPSS Statistics software on Apple Macintosh OSX operating systems requires an Intel processor. 

A) Apple Macintosh MacOS High Sierra (10.13) 

Support for IBM SPSS Statistics 25 only. Please note that no other SPSS release will be officially supported on High Sierra, but older versions like SPSS Statistics 24 may run as well on High Sierra. 

NOTE: There's a known issue with some of the earlier release of Mac High Sierra system (13.0 and 13.1 beta version). 
The top menu of SPSS 25 may disappear if the Mac OS system is set to Non-English. 
The official MacOSX 10.13.1 version do not have this issue. So, if you encountert this issue you need to update your Mac OS version to latest official 10.13.1 build from Apple. 

 

B) Apple Macintosh MacOS Sierra (10.12) 

Support for IBM SPSS Statistics 25 and IBM SPSS Statistics 24 only. For release 24 It is also recommended to install the latest FixPack 2 for release 24 on Mac [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24043574]. [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24042675] 

No older SPSS Statistics releases are supported on Sierra. 

 

C) Apple Macintosh OSX El Capitan (10.11) 

Support for IBM SPSS Statistics 24. Please see the Release notes - IBM SPSS Statistics 24.0 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27047057] for known issues on Macintosh. 

Full documentation including installation material provided in different languages and manuals for release 24 can be found on IBM SPSS Statistics 24 Documentation [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27047033] webpage. 

 

Also, Support for IBM SPSS Statistics 23. Note: if you want to install on El Capitan, please refer to technote 1970391 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21970391] 

 

D) Apple Macintosh OSX Yosemite (10.10) 

Support for IBM SPSS Statistics 24, IBM SPSS Statistics 23 and IBM SPSS Statistics 22 

 

Note: Mac OSX 10.10 (Yosemite) was released on Thursday, October 16th 2014 by Apple after Statistics 22 was released. If you like to use Statistics 22 on Yosemite you need to install Statistics 22 Fixpack 2 as well. Statistics 22 FixPack 2 and release Statistics 23 are fully tested on Yosemite OSX 10.10. So if you like to run Statistics 22 on Yosemite please install Statistics 22 FixPack 2 and also read the section below: 

**** 

In some instances it can be necessary to re-install the legacy Apple Java 6 on 10.10 for the use of Statistics 22 FixPack 2 on this platform

Download and re-install Apple Java 6 

- After you upgraded your Apple Mac OSX from a previous release to 10.10, Apple Java 6 may no longer exists on your upgraded system. If you then launch Statistics 22 which is an application that relies on Java 6, it can happen, the Mac OS pops up a dialog box stating Java 6 was requested, but none is present.
- The Java dialog has a "More Info" button, which when clicked opens a browser to an Apple Tech Support page for Apple Java 2014-001. A download link is provided:
http://support.apple.com/kb/dl1572 [http://support.apple.com/kb/dl1572]
- Click on the download link and a DMG containing the Java 6 installer is downloaded.
- Then you open the Java DMG, double click on the Java installer, follow the prompts and complete the installation of Java 6.

******* 

 

E) Apple Macintosh OSC Mavericks (10.9) 

Support for IBM SPSS Statistics 23 and IBM SPSS Statistics 22

 IBM TroubleShooting: JavaServer Pages (JSP) problems - United States JSPs; TroubleShootingDocument; troublehooting TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Troubleshooting JSP problems for WebSphere® Application Server. This should help address common issues with this component before calling IBM support and save you time. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The following are some examples of common JSP problems and some basic information on how to resolve them: 

 * java.io.FileNotFoundException: JSPG0036E: Failed to find resource
   If the browser displays a JSPG0036E: Failed to find resource message, the JSP processor cannot find the specified JSP page in the Web module, as shown below.
   
   java.io.FileNotFoundException: JSPG0036F: Failed to find /Tests/index.jsp
   at com.ibm.ws.jsp.webcontainerext.JSPExtensionProcessor.findWrapper (JSPExtensionProcessor.java:246)
   at com.ibm.ws.jsp.webcontainerext.JSPExtensionProcessor.handleRequest (JSPExtentionProcessor.java:228)
   ... 
   Take following steps to verify URL being requested order to debug this exception:
   
   To determine the URL of the installed application, you need to use the administrative console to view the configuration of a number of items. The format of the URL is as follows:
   
   http://host:port/context_root/resource_name 
   Finding <host>:<port>
   When a Web module is installed, a virtual host is associated with it. To find the virtual host using the WebSphere Application Server administrative console:  1. Select Applications > Application type > WebSphere Enterprise Applications.
       
       
    2. Select the application name to open the details page.
       
       In the Web module Properties section, click Virtual hosts.
       
       
    3. Note the virtual hosts that are used by the specified application Web module.
   
   
   To find the host and port numbers that are valid for the virtual host:  1. Select Environment > Virtual Hosts.
       
       
    2. Choose the virtual host, and then under Additional Properties, click Host Aliases.
       
       
    3. The list contains the host name and port combinations that can be used to access this virtual host. The host name column should contain values that are registered in a DNS server as a host name for the WebSphere Application Server. An asterisk (*) in the host column indicates that any name can be used. In this case, use the server host name.
   
   
   Finding <context_root>
   The context root is the Web application root and is used to identify the application in the URI. To find the context root:  1. In the WebSphere Application Server administrative console, click Applications > Application type > WebSphere Enterprise Applications.
       
       
    2. Select the target application, then under Detail Properties, click View Deployment Descriptor.
       
       
    3. Review the <context-root> tag for the specified Web module in the related deployment descriptor tag.
   
   
   Finding <resource_name>
   To find the initial file for the application (for example, index.jsp), you can look at the welcome file list in the Web deployment descriptor. As per J2EE specification, JSP files should reside under web module root or under sub directory other than META-INF and WEB-INF.
   
   For example:  * Web module root :
      
      install_root\profiles\profile_name\installedApps<CELL>\<EAR>\<WAR> 
      
   
   In the preceding case, the index.jsp file should reside uner Web_module_root/Test directory. If not, than it explains this error message. 
   
 * JSP not reloading
   If, after modifying and saving a JSP file, the change does not show up in the browser, you need to check the reload settings in the Web module configuration and the JSP runtime reload settings. For the JSPs, the Web container reloads a Web module only when the IBM extension reloadingEnabled in the ibm-web-ext.xmi file is set to true.
   
   The following is an example of web module reloading settings in the ibm-web-ext.xmi file:
   
   <webappext:WebAppExtension xmi:version="2.0" xmlns:xmi="http://www.omg.org/XMI" xmlns:webappext="webappext.xmi" xmi:id="WebAppExtension_1109270589179" reloadInterval="3" reloadingEnabled="true" fileServingEnabled="true"> 
   Location of the ibm-web-ext.xmi file :
   
   install_root\profiles\profile_name\config\cells\cell_name
   \applications\<EAR>\deployments\app_name\<WAR>\WEB-INF\ibm-web-ext.xmi 
   Configuring JSP runtime reloading:
   You have the ability to modify the JSP processor behavior for different JSP stages (such as development, testing, or production environments). This done by configuring specific attributes in the IBM Web module extensions that affect the JSP runtime reload behavior.
   
   JSP files can be translated and compiled at runtime when the JSP file or its dependencies are modified. This is known as JSP reloading. JSP reloading is enabled through the reloadEnabled JSP engine parameter in the ibm-web-ext.xmi configuration file.
   
   The JSP engine settings are stored in the ibm-web.ext.xmi file, as shown 
   <jspAttributes xmi:id="JSPAttribute_1" name="reloadEnabled" value="true"/>

 * Encoding and internationalization issues
   Encoding and internationalization problems usually showup as garbage characters in Web pages and input from user interpreted incorrectly. Double Byte Character Set (DBCS) character processing is a common issue for encoding problems. DBCS is used for languages such a Chinese, Korean, and Japanese, where a single byte is not sufficient to represent all characters in the alphabet. Proper coding and configuration usually resolves these problems. For JSP pages, page encoding is the character encoding in which the file is encoded. For JSP pages in standard syntax, the page encoding is determined from the following sources:  1. The pageEncoding attribute of the page directive of the page 
    2. The charset value of the contentType attribute of the page directive
   
   
   If none of these is provided, ISO-8859-1 is used as the default page encoding.
   
   Page directive implementation in JSP code:
   
   <HTML>
   <HEAD>
   <%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html; charset=UTF-8" pageEncoding="ISO-8859-15" %>
   <META http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">
   <TITLE>Receiving parameters</TITLE>
   </HEAD>
   <BODY>
   <H1>
   Your data is <%= request.getParameter("name") %>
   </H1>
   </BODY>
   </HTML> 
   The pageEncoding and contentType attributes determine the page character encoding of only the file that physically contains the page directive. 
   
 * java.lang.IllegalStateException
   This exception is thrown when attempt is made to modify HttpServletResponse object after it has been committed.
   
   If you have written something in the response buffer, you cannot forward a page:
   
   [7/8/05 20:36:25:694 ART] 0000004f ServletWrappe E SRVE0068E: Could not invoke the service() method on servlet TestServlet. Exception thrown : java.lang.IllegalStateException
   at com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.webapp.WebAppDispatcherContext.sendRedirect(WebAppDispatcherContext.java:486)
   at com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.srt.SRTServletResponse.sendRedirect(SRTServletResponse.java:810)
   ...
   [7/8/05 20:36:25:784 ART] 0000004f SRTServletRes W WARNING: Cannot set status. Response already committed. 
   Calls to the following methods, after a committing response, will cause the java.lang.IllegalStateException error to occur:  1. setBufferSize(0) 
    2. reset() 
    3. resetBuffer() 
    4. sendError() 
    5. sendRedirect() 
    6. RequestDispatcher.forward() or performing jsp:forward
   
   
   Two other common variants of this exception are: 
   java.lang.IllegalStateException: Header already sent 
   One or more headers have been committed to the client, so you cannot set that header again. 
   java.lang.IllegalStateException: OutputStream already obtained 
   In case of JSP, the default output stream has always been created when the JSP has been translated to servlet. Creating and associating another output stream is the reason for this problem. The following piece of code will describe the reason for this error condition: 
   try
   {
   lStream = pResponse.getOutputStream();
   lStream.write(lDocument);
   lStream.flush();
   }
   catch (java.io.IOException ioe)
   {
   logger.error("Exception writing ... to page output stream.");
   }
   finally
   {
   try
   {
   if (lStream != null)
   {
   lStream.close();
   }
   }
   catch (java.io.IOException ioe)
   {
   logger.error("Exception closing page output stream.");
   }
   } 
   Two output streams cannot be associated with one JSP file.

 IBM After upgrading to 7.0.1.0 you get SSL error AMQ9716 - United States AMQ9716 7.0.1.0 SSL OCSP SSL TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You upgrade to WebSphere MQ 7.0.1.0 (or later) and have SSL enabled channels. After the upgrade you notice that in the Queue Manager error LOGs you see the following error message:

AMQ9716: Remote SSL certificate revocation status check failed for channel '????'. 
The channel does not start. 

SYMPTOM
Error AMQ9716


CAUSE
With the release of WebSphere MQ V7.0.1.0 the use of OCSP certificate revocation checking was included. With this new feature, most likely your SSL certificates have a OCSP AuthorityInfoAccess (AIA) certificate extension embedded inside them. 


This was ignored before V7.0.1.0. Now it is being used to verify the certificate. The most likely cause of the failure is that the system can not access the servers listed in the AIA. This then returns a UNKNOWN status when the check is done. The default action for MQ is to not allow the channel to start and the AMQ9716 to be reported when the UNKNOWN is returned.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The best thing to do in this case is to determine the cause of the UNKNOWN return code and fix it. 


There are two possible methods to discover which OCSP AuthorityInfoAccess URL is embedded in a certificate. 

Method 1.
Place the certificate on a Windows machine; ensure to use a file extension of "crt" and double-click it. View the detail extensions for the AIA. 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21399255&amp;aid=1]

Method 2
Use IBM Key Management (gskit) GUI to view them. Issue the following command::
In Windows: strmqikm 
In UNIX: gsk7ikm (MQ V7) or runmqckm (MQ V8)

From the IBM Key Management window:
Select View/Edit for certificate
View Details
Extensions
AuthorityInfoAccess

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21399255&amp;aid=2]

The first step would be to insure that connection to the URL in your certificate can be reached.


Work-around:
Use this only as a temporary fix until the root cause can be found.
You can do the following. It will still do OCSP checking and if REVOKED is returned then the channel will not start. A GOOD return code will allow the channel to start. If UNKNOWN is returned it will not stop the channel from starting and the AMQ9716 will not be reported.

UNIX and Linux systems add the following to qm.ini
SSL:
OCSPAuthentication=OPTIONAL

To set for a Windows Queue Manager, run the following command:
amqmdain reg YourQMgrName -c add -s SSL -v OCSPAuthentication=OPTIONAL

The OCSPAuthentication setting is also applicable to clients and can also be set in the client ini file (e.g. mqclient.ini). Changes to the client OCSPAuthentication setting will take effect after the application is restarted.

On a queue manager, users will need to issue a REFRESH SECURITY TYPE(SSL) command (or the GUI/PCF equivalent) in order for the change in SSL settings to take effect.

OCSP provides your SSL channels with additional security. Once the cause of the AMQ9716 error has been addressed then you are strongly recommended to re-enable OCSP enforcement

 IBM OMEGAMON XE MQ Monitoring Agent Issue the ALTER QLOCAL Command - United States ALTER QLOCAL command event TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 We have the OMEGAMON XE for Messaging on zOS. The agent is configured to monitor all the queue managers (QMGRS) on the same lpar, however, we can see the agent sometimes issues the 'alter Qlocal' command on a QMGR. Why is the agent issuing this command? 

ANSWER
When a queue full event occurs, WebSphere MQ will disable the event. To ensure that subsequent queue full events will occur, the OMEGAMON XE for Messaging agent will re-enable the queue full event once it determines the queue is no longer full via an ALTER QL(qname) QDPMAXEV(ENABLED) command. Other than Take Action commands, this is the only ALTER command that the OMEGAMON XE for Messaging agent will issue.

Prior to installation 

For information about the tasks you must complete before you install the product, refer to the WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 documentationat: 

http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSKM8N_8.0.0/mapfiles/help_home_msgbroker.html [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSKM8N_8.0.0/mapfiles/help_home_msgbroker.html]


Check the WebSphere Message Broker system requirements to ensure that your installation platform is supported for the product edition that you are planning to install. The WebSphere Message Broker system requirements web page is available at:
http://www.ibm.com/software/integration/wbimessagebroker/requirements/ [http://www.ibm.com/software/integration/wbimessagebroker/requirements/] 

Two editions of WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 are available on Windows: 

 *  WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 Windows x86 (32-bit Broker runtime component) WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 Windows x86-64 (64-bit Broker runtime component) 

The 64-bit edition of WebSphere Message Broker is not supported on all 64-bit versions of the Windows Operating System. For more information, see the WebSphere Message Broker system requirements web page. Installing 

Applying service to z/OS 

If you are applying service to z/OS, the Program Temporary Fix (PTF) packages must be downloaded as binary files, and then transferred to z/OS:
1. Download the PTF packages as binary files from the WebSphere Message Broker Support Site at http://www.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/Software/WebSphere/WebSphere_Message_Broker [http://www.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/Software/WebSphere/WebSphere_Message_Broker] and save the files to your workstation.
2. Allocate sequential datasets with the following attributes: 

 * 
 * 
 * Record format . . . : FB 
 * Record length . . . : 1024 
 * Block size . . . . : 6144 
 * 1st extent tracks . : 500 
 * Secondary tracks . : 50


You can use the following sample Job Control Language (JCL) to allocate these datasets:  * 
 * 
 * INSERT A VALID JOBCARD HERE
 * //* 
 * //ALLOCATE EXEC PGM=IEFBR14 
 * //SYSMOD1 DD DSN=YOUR HIGH LEVEL QUALIFIER (HLQ).PTF NUMBER.TRS, 
 * // DISP=(NEW,CATLG,DELETE), 
 * // UNIT=SYSDA, 
 * // SPACE=(TRK,(500,50),RLSE), 
 * // DSORG=PS, 
 * // DCB=(RECFM=FB,LRECL=1024,BLKSIZE=6144) 
 * //*

3. Transfer the binary files from your local workstation to z/OS. File Transfer Protocol (FTP) can be used to transfer the files to the target z/OS as binary files by using the replace option, for example: put PTF NUMBER.TRS 'YOUR HLQ.PTF NUMBER.TRS' (replace
4. Unpack the datasets using the TRSMAIN utility program. This utility is freely available at http://techsupport.services.ibm.com/390/trsmain.html [http://techsupport.services.ibm.com/390/trsmain.html]. 

You can use the following sample JCL to unpack the datasets after the changes have been made, and a suitable job card added: 

 * 
 * 
 * //* UNTERSE APAR 
 * //***************************************************** 
 * /UNPACK EXEC PGM=TRSMAIN,PARM='UNPACK' 
 * //STEPLIB DD DISP=SHR,DSN=TERSE.LOADLIB 
 * //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=* 
 * //INFILE DD DSN=YOUR HLQ.PTF NUMBER.TRS, 
 * // DISP=SHR 
 * //OUTFILE DD DSN=YOUR HLQ.PTF NUMBER, 
 * // DISP=(NEW,CATLG), 
 * // SPACE=(TRK,(1000,100,)) 
 * /*

5. Apply the resulting files using System Modification Program/Extended(SMP/E) for z/OS RECEIVE and APPLY.

TOP Known problems and their workarounds (if any): This section outlines the known problems and their workarounds (if any) of WebSphere Message Broker, by component. 






TOP Installation 
 * Windows: Uninstallation executable program is not signed Symptoms: 
   
   If you run the WebSphere Message Broker uninstallation program uninstaller.exe, and you are using Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2, a dialogue might be displayed warning that the uninstallation file is unsigned. 
   
   Solution: 
   
   This warning can be safely ignored. Continue with the uninstallation process. 
   
   
   
 * Windows: Attachment Manager Symptoms: 
   
   If you are installing an IBM product by using an electronic image from IBM Passport Advantage, and you are using Windows XP Service Pack 2 or later, your Windows Security settings might cause Attachment Manager to block the content of the installer .zip file, causing your installation to fail. 
   
   Solution: 
   
   To work around this problem, complete the following steps: 
   
    * 
    * 
    * 
    * Properties
    * 
    * 
    * 
    * General
    * 
    * Unblock
    * 
   
   
   For more information about Windows Attachment Manager, refer to the Microsoft Support site at: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/883260 [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/883260]
   
 * HP-UX: Runtime component supplied on a physical DVD The installation image for the WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 GA runtime component has exceeded the 700 MB limit recommended for a physical CD. For this reason, the installation image for the HP-UX platform is supplied on a physical DVD rather than a physical CD. The installation image for the WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 GA runtime component is also available from the Passport Advantage website. For information about downloading WebSphere Message Broker Version V8.0 installation images from the Passport Advantage website, see the Download WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 from the Passport Advantage website download document, which is available at:
   http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24030968 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24030968]
   
   
   
 * Installing using the fix pack installer Symptoms: 
   
   The WebSphere Message Broker V8.0.0.0 GA runtime installer requires that you accept the license agreement.
   The fix pack installer requires either that you install on a system that already has WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 GA installed, or that you provide the original WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 GA license files. The WebSphere message Broker V8.0 GA license files can be from either an existing V8.0 runtime installation, or from the original V8.0 installation media. The location of the license files is required only when you are installing a WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 fix pack on a system on which an installation of WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 GA has not been detected. 
   
   Solution: 
   
   GUI or Console installations
   For a fix pack GUI or console installation where V8.0 does not already exist on the system, the installer will prompt you to provide the path to existing media licenses or an existing installation of V8.0.
   Where V8.0 is already installed on the system, you should not be prompted for existing licences, and the installation will progress as normal. 
   
   Silent installations
   For silent installations (full media or fixpack) you must always accept the license, so for example 
   
   
   For a full GA silent media installation
   Add the argument: -DLICENSE_ACCEPTED=TRUE to your silent command, or to the response file you have referenced
   For example on windows command line
   setup32.exe -i silent -DLICENSE_ACCEPTED=TRUE
   
   For a fix pack silent installation where V8.0 already exists on the system
   Add the argument: -DLICENSE_ACCEPTED=TRUE to your silent command, or to the silent response file you have referenced
   For example on windows command line
   8.0.0-WS-MB-WINIA32-FP0001.exe -i silent -DLICENSE_ACCEPTED=TRUE
   
   For a fix pack silent installation where V8.0 does not already exist on the system
   Also add the argument: -DExternal_License_Path=<path to licenses> to your silent command, or to the silent response file you have referenced
   For example on windows command line pointing at the original media in the D: drive
   8.0.0-WS-MB-WINIA32-FP0001.exe -i silent -DLICENSE_ACCEPTED=TRUE -DExternal_License_Path="D:\messagebroker_ia_runtime1\license
   
   Note if pointing at an existing installation of V8.0.0.0 the path is subtly different
   For example on windows command line pointing at the original media in the D: drive
   8.0.0-WS-MB-WINIA32-FP0001.exe -i silent -DLICENSE_ACCEPTED=TRUE -DExternal_License_Path="C:\Program Files\IBM\MQSI\8.0.0.0\license\8.0.0.0"
   
   



 * Instructions for installing the WebSphere Message Broker runtime and ODBC Database Extender components with a non-root user ID Symptoms: 
   
   In the information center topic "Security on Linux and UNIX systems" (bh26031), steps 3d) and 3e) for installing the runtime and ODBC Database Extender (IE02) components with a non-root user ID are incorrect. If you follow the steps described in the topic, the product will not install correctly. 
   
   Solution: 
   
   Replace steps 3d) and 3e) in the topic with the following new steps 3d) to 3i):

TOP Platforms 

Ubuntu WebSphere Message Broker is supported on Ubuntu, but only for development systems. Production systems should not be used to run WebSphere Message Broker on Ubuntu. 

For more information, see the WebSphere Message Broker system requirements page. The WebSphere Message Broker system requirements web page is available at:
http://www.ibm.com/software/integration/wbimessagebroker/requirements/ [http://www.ibm.com/software/integration/wbimessagebroker/requirements/] 


 * Unable to connect a node that has multiple output terminals to other nodes (116214) Symptoms 
   
   When attempting to connect a node that has multiple output terminals to other nodes, a connection is not created. 
   
   Solution 
   
   To work around this problem, complete one of the following steps: 
   
    *  Set the following environment variable: GDK_NATIVE_WINDOWS=1 
   
   OR  *  Use a different window manager 
   
   

Solaris and HP-UX 
 * Increase in bipbroker and DataFlowEngine memory footprint on Solaris and HP-UX platforms Symptoms 
   
   When upgrading from 8.0.0.1 to 8.0.0.2, bipbroker and DataFlowEngine processes running on Solaris or HP platforms might consume an additional 204 MB of memory. This is caused by an increase in the default size of the ReservedCodeCacheSize parameter in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) used by the broker processes. This area of memory is related to the just-in-time compilation of Java classes and was increased by the JVM supplier in response to an increase in bug reports from third party products failing due to exhaustion of space in the code cache. 
   
   Solution 
   
   Customers should use the default value for this parameter, but if this causes unnecessary resource contention, the default can be reverted to its former value by exporting the following environment variable in the broker's profile prior to starting the broker: 
   
    * 
    * 
   
   

AIX  * DataFlowEngine abend on AIX when resolving hostname  
   
   Symptoms
   The DataFlowEngine process running on AIX may terminate on startup or during a deploy with the following call stack in the abend/core file: 
   calloc [] 
   getaddrinfo [] 
   Java_java_net_Inet6AddressImpl_lookupAllHostAddr 
   
   Solution
   Apply AIX equivalent APAR fix for IV95824.
   Alternatively apply one of the following workarounds: 
   1) Specify hosts resolution order in /etc/netsvc.conf so that IPv4 is resolved first. For example: 
   hosts=local4,bind4 
   2) Export the following environment variable setting: 
   IBM_JAVA_OPTIONS=-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true 
   
   





TOP Migration 
 * Brokers running fix pack 8.0.0.2 with new function capability enabled cannot participate in a multiple-broker global cache with brokers running 8.0.0.1. Symptom: 
   
   After upgrading to fix pack 8.0.0.2, cache catalog servers fail to start. All cache components report BIP7190 warnings. 
   
   Solution: 
   
   In 8.0.0.2, by default, each WebSphere eXtreme Scale server participating in the global cache starts with a domain name that is derived by the broker.
   Previously in 8.0.0.1 the domain name for all servers in all embedded caches was an empty string. Servers in different domains cannot collaborate in the same grid.
   Therefore, for a cache that spans more than one broker, you must enable the new capability for these brokers at the same time. 
   
   Enable the new capability by using the -f parameter on the mqsichangebroker command. 
   
   Brokers running fix pack 8.0.0.2 without new functionality enabled can still collaborate in the same grid as brokers running 8.0.0.1.
   In this scenario, the servers running 8.0.0.2 will continue to use an empty string as the domain name, and will report a BIP7140 warning message to the system log with this information.
   
   





TOP WebSphere Message Broker Explorer 
 * Connecting to a queue manager requires a SHARECNV value that is greater than 0 To connect the WebSphere Message Broker Explorer to a queue manager to receive publications, the SHARECNV property on that queue manager's SVRCONN channel must have a value that is greater than 0. This value is required if you want to use the Broker Statistics or Broker Statistics Graph views in WebSphere Message Broker Explorer.
   
   





TOP WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit 
 * Reset the Broker Application Development perspective after migrating Symptom: 
   
   After migrating the WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit and its resources to V8.0, items might be displayed in the WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit that are removed in V8.0; for example, previous toolkit options in menus. 
   
   Solution: 
   
   To resolve this problem, complete the following step: 
   
    * 
    * Window > Reset Perspective
    * 
   
   
   After the perspective is reset, menus and views are updated for Version 8.0.
   
 * Migrating or importing resources to a WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit V8.0.0.0 or V8.0.0.1 workspace, might result in erroneous errors. Symptom: 
   
   After migrating or importing WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit and its resources to V8.0.0.0 or V8.0.0.1, erroneous errors might be displayed in the Toolkit. 
   
   Solution: 
   
   With your V8.0.0.0 or V8.0.0.1 workspace open in the WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit, select Project > Clean... > Clean all projects. The erroneous error messages are removed.
   
   
   
 * Importing resources into a new workspace might require project clean Symptom: 
   
   When you import resources into a new workspace, error messages might display after autobuild is complete. 
   
   Solution: 
   
   In the Broker Development view, select your projects and right-click Project > Clean to rebuild the projects. After the projects are cleaned, the error messages relating to the import are removed.
   
   
   
 * Specifying a new workspace with mqsicreatebar might require project clean Symptom: 
   
   When you run the mqsicreatebar command and specify a new workspace, error messages might display. 
   
   Solution: 
   
   Use the -cleanBuild option when running the mqsicreatebar command to clean the projects.
   
   
   
 * DFDL topics in the WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit are displayed in US English only Symptom: 
   
   When using the information center that is included in the WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit V8.0.0.0 GA, Data Format Description Language (DFDL) topics are displayed in US English only.
   These topics have the identifier "dfxxxxx_", where "xxxxx" is a five-digit number. 
   
   Solution: 
   
   This problem is fixed in WebSphere Message Broker version 8.0.0.1.
   
   Users of WebSphere Message Broker version 8.0.0.0 GA can view these topics, in a language other than US English, using the online product documentation. The online product documentation for WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 contains the latest translated documentation, and is available at: 
   
   http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSKM8N_8.0.0/mapfiles/help_home_msgbroker.html [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSKM8N_8.0.0/mapfiles/help_home_msgbroker.html]
   
   
   
 * Java, PHP, and Message Set projects having the same name can only belong to one Application or Library Symptom: 
   
   If a customer has more than one application or library in their workspace which requires a Java, PHP, or Message Set projects having the same name, an error message similar to the following will appear:
   The project < Project Name > can not be a member of multiple applications or libraries.... 
   
   Solution: 
   
   Where an identical project is required in more than one application or library, a copy of the project should be made, and given a different name.
   
   
   
 * Documentation contains incorrect instructions for installing the WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit as a non-admin user Symptom: 
   
   Non-admin user is not able to install Toolkit while following current installation documentation. 
   
   Solution: 
   
   This problem is fixed in WebSphere Message Broker version 8.0.0.1.
   
   Users of WebSphere Message Broker 8.0.0.0, who are installing Toolkit as a non-admin user, can refer to the online product documentation at [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmbhelp/v8r0m0/index.jsp]http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSKM8N_8.0.0/mapfiles/help_home_msgbroker.html [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSKM8N_8.0.0/mapfiles/help_home_msgbroker.html], or 
   
   
 * Step 5 of the WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit V8.0.0.0 installation documentation should be updated as follows:  * 
    * 
    *  On Windows run the following command: <disk1 image>\installToolkit.bat -nonAdmin On Linux run the following script: <disk1 image>/installToolkit.sh -nonAdmin 
   
   
 * Step 14 should be added to the WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit V8.0.0.0 installation documentation and read as follows:  * 
    * 
    *  On Windows run command: <WMBT80_Home>\wmbt\postconfig\postInstall_admin.bat On Linux run script: <WMBT80_Home>/wmbt/postconfig/postInstall_admin.sh 
    * 
   
   
 * When using an application project and a subflow with a .msgflow extension it is possible to create a BAR file with a duplicate message flow if the sub-flows have been used incorrectly in the previous release. Symptom: 
   
   This is caused when an External InputNode is added to the sub-flow; the resultant BAR file will contain two compiled message flows. One of the message flows will be the intended flow with the sub-flow embedded, the other message flow will be the extraneous sub-flow containing the ExternalInputNode without an appropriate ExternalOutput Node. 
   
   When the BAR file is deployed both of the message flows will run. The sub-flow will incorrectly start a new thread and attempt to read data from the InputNode. 
   
   Solution: 
   
   Either : 
   
    * 
    * 
    * 
   
   
   
 * Launching the WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit from Installation Manager makes the toolkit use WebSphere MQ 7.0.1 Symptom: 
   
   When an installation has completed, the user is provided the option to start the WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 Toolkit. When the toolkit opens, any broker which is running with a queue manager on WebSphere MQ version 7.1 or 7.5 will be reported as stopped, irrespective of whether the broker is running or not. A dialogue might be displayed warning the brokers can not be connected to. 
   
   If a user tries to start one of the brokers which is stopped, an error message is displayed containing the following text: 
   
   The queue manager '<QueueManager>' is not running (MQ reason code 2059 while trying to connect) 
   
   Check that: 
   
    * 
    * 
    * 
   
   If a user tries to start one of the brokers which is already started, a dialogue is displayed indicating that the broker can not be started as it is already running. Solution: 
   
   Shut down the toolkit and re-open it using the toolkit installation and not by using Installation Manager.
   
   
   
 * A version of XULRunner which is not compatible with Eclipse 3.6 (upon which WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit is based) may cause the Linux toolkit to crash shortly after being launched. Symptom: 
   
   Within a minute or so of launching the Linux toolkit, it crashes with the following error:
   JVM terminated - Exit code=160 
   
   Solution: 
   
   Install a version of XULRunner which is compatible with Eclipse 3.6. 
   
   Compatible versions of XULRunner are versions 1.8-3.6 and associated fix packs. 
   
   Testing at IBM has been done using the following version, and this has been confirmed to resolve the issue:
   http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/xulrunner/releases/1.9.2.19/runtimes/xulrunner-1.9.2.19.en-US.linux-i686.tar.bz2 [http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/xulrunner/releases/1.9.2.19/runtimes/xulrunner-1.9.2.19.en-US.linux-i686.tar.bz2] 
   
   Expand the downloaded compressed file into a convenient directory ( e.g. /usr/lib/xulrunner_new) 
   
   Add the following line to the eclipse.ini file under the mb install directory:
   -Dorg.eclipse.swt.browser.XULRunnerPath=<location of unzipped download> ( e.g. -Dorg.eclipse.swt.browser.XULRunnerPath=/usr/lib/xulrunner_new)
   
   





TOP Web Services 
 * No known issues.




TOP Web UI 
 * Upload of WSDL on zOS in the Web UI is not supported On WebSphere Message Broker version 8.0.0.1 on zOS, you can not currently upload WSDL files using the Web UI for use in the Web Based Static Endpoint pattern.
   
   





TOP Nodes  * After applying fixpack containing APAR IT01950 error BIP2503 is received.

 * 
 * Symptoms:
 * WebSphere Message Broker has been modified so that if ESQL containing a FOR statement which iterates over a SHARED ROW variable contains a PROPAGATE statement within the FOR block then any attempt to write to that shared variable will result in an exception BIP2503 "Propagate with a SHARED variable lock held by FOR statement" being thrown.
   
   The reason for this is that while iterating over a SHARED ROW variable a lock is held on the variable, this lock is also obtained when writing to the variable in downstream nodes and the exact timing of these operations could result in a deadlock occurring. It is not valid to modify the SHARED ROW variable being iterated over in downstream nodes as it may invalidate the loop therefore behavior has been changed to throw an exception instead of deadlocking.
   
   Solution: 
 * This means that there may be some flows which were at risk of deadlocking which now throw an exception. The recommended action is to modify the flows so that they do not use the affected invalid pattern however if this is not possible the previous behavior can be restored by setting the environment variable MQSI_ALLOW_PROPAGATE_WITH_SHARED_LOCK_HELD=1 and restarting the Broker.




TOP WebSphere Adapter nodes 
 * Saving Enterprise Metadata Discovery (EMD) adapter connection information during iterative discovery Symptoms: 
   
   During WebSphere Adapter for SAP Software Enterprise Metadata Discovery (EMD) iterative discovery, the Adapter Connection wizard Service Generation and Deployment Configuration panel is displayed and can be edited; however, any adapter system connection information that you enter is not saved in the adapter component. 
   
   Solution: 
   
   Use the WebSphere Adapters editor to change the adapter system connection information to ensure that subsequent EMD iterative discoveries preserve the adapter system connection information: 
   
    * 
    * 
    * 
    * Open With
    * 
    * WebSphere Adapters editor
    * 
    * 
    * 
    * 
    * 
   
   
   
 * Assured delivery option for JDEdwards is not supported Symptoms: 
   
   The JDE inbound adapter fails to deploy if the assured delivery check box is selected in the adapter wizard. The following error is issued: 
   
   An attempt to set the property 'AssuredOnceDelivery' on adapter component 'AssuredDeliveryMSApp.IBM WebSphere Adapter for JD Edwards EnterpriseOne' failed because the property is not supported. 
   
   Solution: 
   
   This functionality is not currently supported, and should not be used in message flow development.
   
   





TOP Graphical Data Mapper 
 * Using a graphical data map to map input data that is retrieved from a database uses the default database schema name specified for the configured JDBC connection identity Symptoms: 
   
   Using a graphical data map to map input data that is retrieved from a database is dependent on the default schema name configuration of your database server. The broker does not currently provide a facility to override the database schema name to be used in the SQL statements issued against the database. Currently, the SQL statement issued by the map includes only the database and table name but not a schema name. As a result, your database server uses the default database schema name for the identity that the broker used to connect to it while running the map. The connection identity that the broker uses is configured in a broker JDBCProvider configurable service. The JDBCProvider configurable service used is selected by the data source name in the map. 
   
   If the required database table is not available in this schema, the map execution fails with a broker error containing specific error codes for your database server. For example:
   BIP3947E: The map processing for QName '{maps}:RDB_Mapping' has failed, with the following details:
   '{Your specific database schema table access error message and codes}' 
   
   Solution: 
   
   This restriction is addressed in WebSphere Message Broker version 8.0.0.1, and later, through provision of the capability to optionally override the name of the database schema. For more information, see JDBCProviders configurable service [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSKM8N_8.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/an60170_.htm] property "databaseSchemaNames". 
   
   Users of WebSphere Message Broker version 8.0 GA should ensure that the table being selected from the graphical data map is available in the schema that is set by your database server for the database connection identity that is configured in the JDBCProvider configurable service. This is particularly restrictive on z/OS.
   
   
   
 * Errors occur during runtime execution of newly created graphical data maps, that were converted from message map (.msgmap) files, or utilise certain extended capabilities such as submaps with multiple inputs, or xs:<type> cast transforms Symptoms: 
   
   The execution of a graphical data map created using WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit version 8.0.0.2 that is deployed to a WebSphere Message Broker Runtime version 8.0 or 8.0.0.1 fails. 
   
   Example error messages: 
   
   BIP2230E: Error detected whilst processing a message in node '<node label>' ComIbmMSLMappingNode: <flow name>
   BIP3946E: The map script generation for QName '<map routine name>' has failed, with the following details: java.lang.RuntimeException: IXJXE0609E: [ERR 0548][ERR XPST0017] The function '<function name>' with parity '<n>' is not in the in-scope function declarations. 
   
   Solution: 
   
   Update the WebSphere Message Broker runtime to version 8.0.0.2.
   
   
   
 * Errors are seen during runtime when using a complex Data Analysis generated GDM map. Symptoms: 
   
   A JVM Out of Memory exception is seen at runtime when using a Data Analysis generated GDM Map

   Solution: 
   
   Use the mqsichangeproperties [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSKM8N_8.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/an09143_.htm] command to increase the maximum heap size to greater than 256Mb.

TOP Commands 
 * Calling mqsiprofile in a zsh shell exits the session (A63403) Symptoms: 
   
   On UNIX systems that use Z shell (zsh) as the shell environment, a call to 'source {install path}/mqsiprofile' causes the shell to exit. Due to the default behavior of zsh, the mqsiprofile command checks an incorrect argument number to determine whether it is being sourced, or run directly. The mqsiprofile script then prints a warning message and calls exit, but zsh interprets this call as an instruction to exit the current shell. 
   
   Solution: 
   
   To work around this problem, complete the following step: 
   
    * In the UNIX terminal, call 'unsetopt function_argzero', then call the mqsiprofile command again.
   
   
   
 * Documentation for mqsiapplybaroverride states support for -k and -y parameters Symptom: 
   
   Information center topic an19545_ mqsiapplybaroverride describes parameters -k and -y for use with applications and libraries. Using these parameters with the command results in the following error:
   BIP1033E Invalid parameters 
   
   Solution: 
   
   These options are not supported with this command, and should not be used.
   
   
   
 * Error "AMQ7027: Argument [QM Name] supplied to command [path]\crtmqm.exe is invalid." is seen when running mqsicreatebroker to create a Domain aware HA Broker on the Windows platform Symptom: 
   
   An AMQ7027 error message might be returned from mqsicreatebroker when creating an HA Broker on the Windows platform when using the new -B or -Q flags if the Queue Manager does not already exist. 
   
   Solution: 
   
   If a Queue Manager does not exist when creating an HA Broker on Windows using the new -B or -Q flags an attempt is made to create a Queue Manager. The mqsicreatebroker command run tries to pass the '-ar' flag to the create Queue Manager (crtmqm) command. 
   
   However, this option is only available for V7.1.0.3 and V7.5.0.1 of MQ. MQ APAR IC85940 provided this function in the Fix Packs.

TOP Databases 
 * Dates inserted into a Microsoft SQLServer database using JDBC are 2 days out 
 * 
   Symptoms :
   After upgrading to WebSphere Message Broker 8.0.0.7 or above, or applying APAR IT03599 to an earlier Fix Pack installation, dates inserted into an SQLServer database using a JDBC connection either through a JavaCompute node or a mapping node are 2 days out.
   WebSphere Message Broker 8.0.0.7 and APAR IT03599 upgrade the level of Java used by the Broker to Java 1.7. Some versions of the Microsoft SQL JDBC driver do not support Java 1.7 and produce unexpected behaviour when used.
   
   Solution:
   Upgrade the version of the Microsoft SQL JDBC driver to a version which supports Java 1.7

 IBM Cannot update a Notice Questionnaire Template or publish a Hold Notice - United States Oracle 11.2.0.4.0 Atlas Publish Questionnaire TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After attempting to update a Notice Questionnaire Template or Publish a Hold Notice using IBM Atlas, the changes are not reflected in the user interface after the action. 

SYMPTOM
This happens for any updates performed on all versions of Atlas running with Oracle 11.2.0.4.0

This is caused by Oracle bug (17501296) in version 11.2.0.4 

ENVIRONMENT
All Platforms

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
After updating a notice questionnaire template or publishing a Hold Notice, no visible change is noticed in the user interface. If the user tries to update using sqlplus, the following exception is thrown when the transaction is committed
ERROR at line 1:
ORA-00604: error occurred at recursive SQL level 1
ORA-06550: line 1, column 7:
PLS-00306: wrong number or types of arguments in call to 'SYNCRN'
ORA-06550: line 1, column 7: PL/SQL: Statement ignored

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Please contact Oracle support and apply the Patch:17501296 

 IBM An unexpected ruleset version is executed - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why is Rule Execution Server (RES) not executing the expected version of a ruleset ?
What are the possible causes after a hot deployment for Rule Execution Server not to use the updated ruleset ? 

CAUSE
Possible causes for unexpected versions to be executed are: 
- the RES client requesting execution may be passing a wrong ruleset path
- a hot deploy notification was not sent by the RES console, or not received by all the Execution Units (XU)
- the ruleset parsing policy may be delaying the use of a ruleset version until its parsing is complete
- the updated ruleset cannot be parsed successfully and RES falls back on an earlier active version that parses


ANSWER
First validate that the RES components (the Execution Unit, the Management Console and the Client Application bundling the RES client library, which may be HTDS, MTDS, the SSP or a custom application) have been installed properly as per the documentation, see Configuring Rule Execution Server [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.config/config_ds_res/tpc_res_config.html]. 

The ruleset version that is executed depends first on the ruleset path that is requested. Specifying a ruleset path with no version ( such as /MyRuleApp/MyRuleset/ ) is interpreted as a request to execute the highest version of the ruleset, as opposed to a version specific ruleset path ( such as /MyRuleApp/2.0/MyRuleset/1.0 ). Validate that the executed ruleset path is indeed unexpected considering the requested ruleset path. 

 

A common situation for an unexpected ruleset version to be executed is that of a hot deployment that is not successfully completed. The more frequent causes for the hot deployment not to happen as expected are: 

 * Permission issue: the user publishing the ruleset update must have sufficient administrative rights ( Monitor role in WebSphere Application Server ) in order for the deployment to notify all the Execution Units of the ruleset update through JMX. For example on WebSphere Application Server see Mapping the resAdministrators group to the Monitor role [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.config/config_ds_res_was8/tsk_was_map_admin_group.html] 
 * Version mismatch between the Execution Unit(s) and the Management Console: in order for the Management Console to detect the presence of execution units the versions of these components must match down to the fix level. For example 7.1.1.4 Management Console would not interact properly with a 7.1.1.3 Execution Unit. The version of the RES console is displayed in the "About" link (top right corner). The version of the Execution Unit can be seen in the resource adapter ra.xml file where a resourceadapter-version tag shows the version. For example with the WebSphere Application Server this can seen through: Resources > Resource adapters > XU > Deployment Descriptor 
 * Asynchronous ruleset parsing is used : in this mode, while an updated ruleset is being parsed, an earlier version of the ruleset can be used for executions that are requested at that time. Note that there is no guarantee of which specific earlier version of the ruleset may be used since it is a factor of which versions are available in the deprecated ruleset cache and whether garbage collection has occurred. In order to remove any uncertainty on the version that can be executed, it is possible to either turn off the asynchronous mode [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.res.managing/topics/tsk_res_config_asynchron_turnoff.html], or force synchronous parsing in asynchronous mode [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.res.managing/topics/tsk_res_config_forcing_sync_pars.html]. 
 * Notification scope is limited to one cell : by design the RES notification mechanism only works within one WebSphere Application Server Cell ( or one JBoss domain, or one Weblogic domain ), so a Management Console may only notify Execution Units that are running on servers in the same cell as the RES Console. See XU notification in a cluster over multiple cells [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21458245]. If you need to implement notifications to several cells at once, the document Ruleset updates and programmatic notification of RES eXecution Unit [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21418646] can be useful. 
 * Parsing failure of an updated ruleset : leading the XU to fall back on an earlier active version that parses successfully 
 * Ruleset update was only written to persistence: writing directly to RES persistence with the ant tasks res-write-db or res-write-file [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.res.managing/topics/tsk_res_deploy_rlapp_ant.html] does not trigger a notification, so the update may only been seen after server restart. 
 * XU MBean is not activated in Java SE mode : See Activating the XU MBean in Java SE [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.res.managing/topics/tsk_res_config_xu_mbean_jse.html] 
 * Multiple Java SE Execution Units are deployed in the same JVM: See Rule Execution Server J2SE mode hot deployment does not seem to work [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21585251]

 IBM Deletion of virtual portal fails with transaction timeout - United States virtual portal; timeout; delete; portlet; EJPAH4000E; EJPEB0804E; rollbackexception; admin; WTRN0006W TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
Attempt to delete virtual portal via Virtual Portal Manager portlet fails with error:

EJPAH4000E: Failed to delete virtual portal 

Attempts to delete the virtual portal using the ConfigEngine task "delete-virtual-portal" may fail as well.


CAUSE
With the introduction of Managed Pages in WebSphere Portal 8.0, virtual portal deletions require more transaction time when removing from the system. This increased transaction time can lead to an error situation if either of the following timeouts is exceeded: 

 * the total and/or maximum transaction lifetime timeout value(s) for the server 
 * the WCM component's transaction timeout

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1. Increase the total transaction lifetime timeout and maximum transaction timeout values (for example, to 600 seconds or greater) using the instructions in the Related information section below. 

2. If the problem persists after addressing the change in suggestion #1 and the error in SystemOut.log shows that the timeout still occurs after 120 seconds (as opposed to the increased value that you just set), then update to Cumulative Fix (CF) 9 or later to get the fix for APAR PI04872 and then add (or update if already exists) the following custom property to the WCM_WCMConfigService Resource Environment Provider: 

Name: wcm.transaction.timeout 

Value: 600 (for example) 

Note: There is not a target value for a transaction timeouts that applies to every customer environment. The goal should be to find a value that allows the virtual portal deletion to succeed but does not introduce significant delay in being alerted for other transaction timeouts.

 IBM How can uninstall Data Studio 3.1.1 where Control Panel uninstall process gets an error? - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 We are able to install Data Studio (DS) 4.1.2 successfully but unable to uninstall the 
existing Data Studio 3.1.1. When uninstall Data Studio 3.1.1 from Control Panel, it 
raises an error message pop-up window and can not uninstall it. Here is the message:

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Java Virtual Machine Launcher
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------
| X Could not find the main class: com.zerog.lax.LAX. Program will exit.
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

How can uninstall Data Studio 3.1.1 where Control Panel uninstall process gets an error?


CAUSE
It is an known behavior/limitation. 

ANSWER
It may be happened where two versions Data Studio 3.1.1 and 4.1.2 installed machine. 

Here is an workaround. Please try to uninstall all products including Install Manager 
(IM) then reinstall IM and Data Studio 4.1.2. Below are detailed steps:

1. Use IM to uninstall as many packages as possible.

2. Identify the packages that are still installed, and manually clean 
them up.

Example on Windows:
- C:\Program Files\IBM\{IBMIMShared | SDPShared}

3. Delete IBM Installation Manager.

Example on Windows:
- Delete the IM install directory:
C:\Program Files\IBM\Installation Manager\
- Delete the AppData directory (IM Agent Data):
Windows 7: C:\ProgramData\IBM\Installation Manager
- Delete the Windows registry (regedit) entry : 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\IBM\Installation Manager
- re-install IM

4. Reinstall DS 4.1.2 and other products.

Note:
This behavior might be changed without notice in the future. We can confirm whether this technote
is valid or not by following above.

2.0 Problems fixed
==================
The following problems are addressed by this fix.

2.1 APARS:
----------

APAR : IV24938
Abstract : WRONG PCT_FREE CALCULATION IN RDB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST
Additional Information: The Oracle Database Extended agent displays a wrong
value for Free Space(%) in the following workspace. The value
that is displayed is less then the real value. 

Archive Node -> Flash Recovery workspace -> 
Flash Recovery Space Usage view

APAR : IV26915
Abstract : ORA-12504: TNS:LISTENER WAS NOT GIVEN
Additional Information: The Oracle Database Extended agent logs are
written at a rapid pace and growing large very quickly.
The following error message repeats:

"ORA-12504: TNS:listener was not given".

APAR : IV30446
Abstract : ALERT LOG MESSAGE TEXT IS GARBLED
Additional Information: The Japanese part of the Oracle alert
log message is garbled in the Tivoli Enterprise Portal.
This garbled information might also occur in other multi-byte 
character set (MBCS) locales, such as East Asian locales 
such as Simplified Chinese or Korean.

APAR : IV31219
Abstract : RDB_SESSION_DETAILS WAREHOUSING ERROR 64
Additional Information: The historical data from the 
attribute group RDB_Session_Details table cannot be
exported into the warehouse, because the value after UTF-8
conversion has a length greater than the column ACTION defined
width (32). Therefore, the row is not exported into
warehouse and the local historical data file size 
increases continuously. This issue might also occur in other
East Asian locales such as Simplified Chinese or Korean.

APAR : IV36395
Abstract : KRZCLIENT FILE HANDLE LEAK ON WINDOWS
Additional Information: "Handle Count" on Windows operating systems 
where the Oracle Extended Database agent is running is constantly 
growing. When the agent is restarted, the krzclient.exe process 
is using hundreds of file handles. The hundreds of file handles 
increases to thousands of file handles in a few hours.

APAR : IV38555
Abstract : KRZCLIENT CRASHES AT TOPSQL
Additional Information: The Oracle Extended Database agent krzclient
process crashes and generates a core file when the process queries 
RDB Top SQL attribute groups.

2.2 Defects
-----------

2.3 Enhancements: 
-----------------

Enhancement: INTERNAL
Abstract: User interface configuration improvements.

- Simplifies the database connection configuration 
with three connection types:
- Basic: Oracle database server host name (or IP address),
Listener port, and Oracle database service
name (or Oracle SID) must be specified.
- TNS: only the TNS Alias must be specified or selected
from the drop-down list that is discovered
from the ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/tnsnames.ora file.
- Advanced: only the Oracle connection string must be 
specified to be compatible with an old
version of agent configuration.

- Supports the following connection string format: 
"//hostname:port/ORACLE_SID".

- At least one database connection must be added during
the GUI configuration.

Enhancement: INTERNAL
Abstract: New environment variables that you can use to 
customize the agent, such as KRZ_LISTENER_INCLUDE, 
KRZ_LISTENER_EXCLUDE, KRZ_TNS_INCLUDE, KRZ_TNS_EXCLUDE,
KRZ_REDIRECT_TNS, KRZ_EVENT_LEVEL, and KRZ_SQL_PREFILTER.

- Provides the option to control whether the agent monitors
the specific Listener name and Oracle net service end points.
Both including and excluding filters are provided 
(KRZ_LISTENER_INCLUDE,KRZ_LISTENER_EXCLUDE, 
KRZ_TNS_INCLUDE, KRZ_TNS_EXCLUDE).

- Provides the option (KRZ_REDIRECT_TNS) to control whether
to redirect the value of the predefined TNS_ADMIN environment
variable to the agent log directory to disable the Oracle 
sqlnet.log.

- Provides the option (KRZ_EVENT_LEVEL) to control which 
level of agent event is sent. The level with a scope from high
to low is MISC, INFO, WARN, or ERROR.

- Provides the option (KRZ_SQL_PREFILTER) to control whether the
agent combines the filter information in the SQL query that is
sent to the Oracle database for the data processing.


Enhancement: INTERNAL
Abstract: Performance improvement for Top SQL monitoring.

Enhancement: INTERNAL
Abstract: Disk Space usage monitoring for Archive Destination
when Archive destination is defined in the Oracle database as
USE_DB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST instead of a real physical directory.

Enhancement: 
Abstract: More SQL statement samples in the krzcussql.properties
customized SQL template file for Oracle Jobs, Oracle Users, 
and Oracle Queues monitoring.

A total of six sample SQL statements are in the default 
customized SQL template file. To ensure the sample customized
SQL can be run successfully, the SELECT authority from 
corresponding Oracle performance views must be granted to the
Oracle user of the agent in advance.

SQL_ID: mytablespace
SQL_TEXT: select * from dba_tables; 
Oracle Views to be granted SELECT permission: dba_tables

SQL_ID: mytest
SQL_TEXT: SELECT SID,

6.3.1-TIV-ITM_EXT-FP0001.

2.5 APARS and defects included from superseded fixes
---------------------------------------------------- 
6.3.1-TIV-ITM_EXT-FP0001
----------------------------------------------------

APAR : IV22637
Abstract : AGENT CORE DUMP IF TNSPING IS NOT ACCESSABLE
Additional Information: A core dump occurs for the Oracle Database 
Extended agent if the agent is configured with KRZ_ORACLE_HOME but, 
$ORACLE_HOME/bin/tnsping file did not grant read+execute permission
to the agent OS user.

APAR : IV14403
Abstract : TABLESPACE PERCENT_FREE_TO_MAX CALCULATE WRONG
Additional Information: The Oracle Database Extended agent might calculate 
the value of the Percent_Free_To_Max attribute incorrectly, because this value
should be greater than the value of the Percent_Free_To_Allocated attribute
in case the Oracle tablespace is set with Autoextend ON and 
the maximum file size of the data file is greater than the allocated size 
for the current datafile.

6.3.1-TIV-ITM_KRZ-IF0002
----------------------------------------------------

APAR: IV08618
Abstract : AGENT OCCUPY ORACLE SESSION MORE AND MORE
Additional Information: The Oracle Database Extended agent occupies the
Oracle sessions increasingly if the Oracle Database Extended agent user
does not have all authorities in the krzgrant.sql file.
This increase is caused by the agent not disconnecting from the Oracle
database, with an error message of "ORA-00942 Table or View does not
exist," and the agent trying to reconnect to the Oracle database with a new
session in each interval.

Defect: 167731
Abstract: agent configure still load based version xml file.
Additional Information: A new rz_dd_063100002.xml file is
installed in the itmhome\config directory by this patch, 
where the base version of the rz_dd_063100000.xml file is installed.

The agent loads the configuration definition from the newly installed
rz_dd_063100002.xml file instead of the base version file.

Defect: 168694
Abstract: cannot ignore Oracle Listener/Net Service definition.
Additional Information: A new KRZ_LOAD_ORACLE_NET environment variable 
is added so you can decide whether the Listener and Net Service End Points
from the files below are required for monitoring.

On UNIX and Linux systems:
$ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/listener.ora
$ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/tnsnames.ora
$TNS_ADMIN/network/admin/listener.ora
$TNS_ADMIN/network/admin/tnsnames.ora

On Windows systems:
%ORACLE_HOME%\network\admin\listener.ora
%ORACLE_HOME%\network\admin\tnsnames.ora
%TNS_ADMIN%\network\admin\listener.ora
%TNS_ADMIN%\network\admin\tnsnames.ora 

If this new variable is set to 'false', the agent
does not load Listener or Net Service definitions from the files above,
even if the agent is configured with ORACLE HOME directory.

The agent still loads Listener or Net Service definition if the agent
is configured with a TNS PATH directory, which contains the
listener.ora or tnsnames.ora files.

Defect: 168966
Abstract: ASM disk/diskgroup display redundancy data.
Additional Information: In an Oracle RAC environment, if there is more
than one active ASM database instance, the agent queries back multiple
rows for each disk or disk group in all active instances.
If there is a situation in monitoring the attributes such as 
KRZ_RDB_ASM_DISKGROUP.Free_Percent, there are
duplicated alerts by this type of situation.

The agent queries back only one record for each disk or disk group, and 
avoids the duplicated alert for the situation.

The following attribute groups are impacted by this fix:

KRZ_RDB_ASM_DISKGROUP
KRZ_RDB_ASM_DISK
KRZ_ASM_DISK
KRZ_ASM_DISKGROUP

Defect: 168967
Abstract: FreeToMax return negative value. 
Additional Information: The agent gets a negative value or over 100% on the
following attributes because the Maximum file size of an Oracle
data file is less than the real data file size:

KRZ_RDB_TABLESPACENORMAL_USAGE.Percentage_Free_To_Maximum
KRZ_RDB_TABLESPACENORMAL_USAGE.Percentage_Allocated
KRZ_RDB_TABLESPACETEMP_USAGE.Percentage_Allocated

Defect: 172392
Abstract: CANNOT MERGE CUSTOM SQL FOR BASETABLE 
Additional Information: Use the KRZ_CUSTOM_SQLXML environment variable 
to specify a customized
krzsql_custom.xml file where the new SQLInfo is defined and the agent
uses SQLInfo from the customized sql xml file instead of the 
default krzsql.xml file. There is a new BaseTable tag in
the SQLInfo from version 6.3.1 and the new definition of
BaseTable cannot overwrite the default definition in the krzsql.xml file.

<SQLInfo ID=
...
</SQLText>
<BaseTable QueryName="SampleTable1" GrantName="SampleTable1"/>
</SQL>

If you do not grant all tables and views to the Oracle Database Extended agent 
user in the krzgrant.sql file, error messages are displayed about ORA-00942
because the agent checks the Oracle authority on the QueryName element 
while the agent runs continuously.

The error message about ORA-00942 can be avoided by using a customized
sql xml file and copying the SQLInfo definition from the default krzsql.xml 
file and replacing the QueryName and GrantName with 'dual'.

<SQLInfo ID=
...
</SQLText>
<BaseTable QueryName="dual" GrantName="dual"/>
</SQL>

Defect: 172695
Abstract: KRZCLIENT LOG FILE LOOP AND OVERWRITE FIRST ONE 
Additional Information: The RAS1 log file for the 
krzstart or krzclient processes loops between 01, 02, and 03. The
first RAS1 log file is overwritten after the 3rd one 
is full. This action disenables you to see information, such as 
start time during agent startup.

After the application of the fix, in the following file examples
the RAS1 log message loops between the 
"tivp56_rz_orcl_krzclient_4eef1fe8-02.log" file and the 
"tivp56_rz_orcl_krzclient_4eef1fe8-03.log" file. The
"tivp56_rz_orcl_krzclient_4eef1fe8-01.log" file
is not overwritten.

#cd /opt/IBM/ITM/logs && ls *krzclient*.log
tivp56_rz_orcl_krzclient_4eef1fe8-01.log
tivp56_rz_orcl_krzclient_4eef1fe8-03.log
tivp56_rz_orcl_krzclient_4eef1fe8-02.log

----------------------------------------------------
APAR : IZ77624
Abstract : AGENT GETS ERROR ORA-01722 INVALID NUMBER ORACLE EXTENDED AGENT
6.3.0 ON DISTRIBUTED PLATFORM
Additional Information: The Oracle Database Extended agent returns no data
to the Tivoli Enterprise Portal because of ORA-01722.

APAR : IZ83799
Abstract : UNDO TABLESPACE %USED IS WRONG
Additional Information: The RDB_TablespaceNormal_Usage attribute group
PCIUSED (% Used) attribute is incorrect for UNDO tablespace.

APAR : IZ84903
Abstract : ITM RZ AGENT DOES NOT SUPPORT ORACLE 9I
Additional Information: The corrected prerequisite was republished
in the information center, see the "Supported applications" section at 
http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcama.doc_6.2.4/oracledatabaseextendedagent.html [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcama.doc_6.2.4/oracledatabaseextendedagent.html]
Note: For Oracle Database Servers: Requires Version 10.1.0.1 or later.

APAR : IZ87013
Abstract : DBCONNECTION IN SUBNODE NOT TRUNCATED
Additional Information: Subnode ID as part of the subnode name must not be
longer then 25 characters, because of IBM Tivoli Monitoring limitations.
The entire subnode ID is truncated instead of the DBConnection part
being truncated.
Note: Subnode ID format: DBConnection-AgentInstance-Hostname.

The following troubleshooting Technote was published:
http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21455513 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21455513]

APAR : IZ92572
Abstract : SITUATION DOES NOT FIRE WITH SCAN FILTER
Additional Information: The Oracle Database Extended agent gets an incorrect
filter operator of 'EQ' when a situation includes the SCAN filter with the 'NE'
operator.
The wrong operator causes the agent not to get the required data from the
Oracle database, and situations cannot be fired even if there are matched
data rows for this situation.

APAR : IZ95428
Abstract : KRZGRANT.SQL RETURNS ORA-01722 ERROR IN AN ORACLE ENVIRONMENT
USING A NON-STANDARD NLS_NUMERIC_CHARACHTERS STRING
Additional Information: Using a non-standard NLS_NUMERIC_CHARACTERS string
in the Oracle environment causes the problem.

APAR : IZ95117
Abstract : CANNOT MONITOR ORACLE TM LOCK
Additional Information: The agent can detect only the Transaction Lock
(type=TX) and cannot detect the DML or Table Lock(type=TM) in the Oracle
database.

APAR : IZ95898
Abstract : KRZCLIENT CORE DUMP AT ALERT LOG READING
Additional Information: krzclient causes a core dump if the alert log is archived
and newly generated alert log is the same size as the previous one.

Defect: 136835
Abstract: RDB Alert Log Details attribute group Message Timestamp attribute
shows an incorrect value for timestamp with timezone.

2.6 Enhancements included from superseded fixes
----------------------------------------------------
6.3.1-TIV-ITM_EXT-FP0001
----------------------------------------------------

Self-describing agent (SDA) application support installation is supported. 
To take advantage of self-describing agent capability, your 
Tivoli Management Services server components must be 
Version 6.2.3 Fixpack 1 or later.

6.3.1-TIV-ITM_KRZ-IF0002
----------------------------------------------------
Enhancement: RFE
Headline: Improve Oracle Database Extended Agent not to contact ORCL instance
(SYS4472)
ID: 12585
Description: 
Stop the behavior where the Oracle Extended Database agent tries to connect
against the Oracle default instance "ORCL" every time when checking
LISTENERs/TNS.
The Oracle Extended Database agent is hard-coded to try to connect against
an Oracle Instance "ORCL" that does not exist on most systems.
By default, the agent tries to connect every 5 minutes. 
Therefore, the Oracle database creates "connect error 12514" Log Entries
each time, which fills up the log files.

Additional Information: The Oracle Extended Database agent uses the tnsping Oracle
utility tool in the ORACLE_HOME/bin path to verify the 
Listener status if the agent is configured with KRZ_ORACLE_HOME. Or, the user
can use the new KRZ_DEFAULT_ORACLE_SERVICE_NAME environment variable to define
a valid service name for the Listener monitoring instead of the hard coded 'ORCL'.

Enhancement: RFE
Headline: RDB Disk Space: Oracle Archive directory is not monitored
correctly 
ID: 13528
Description:
On SAP systems, the Oracle archive destination is defined as 
log_archive_dest=<directory>/<file prefix>, which is not a 
valid or existing directory. "Not Available" is displayed for % Free
attribute within RDB Disk Space attribute group.

Enhancement: RFE
Headline: Oracle RAC One Node Monitoring
ID: 13734
Description:
Oracle RAC One Node is a single instance database that is always online, 
and it is a new option since Oracle 11.2.0.1. The Oracle 
Extended Database agent is not able to monitor the RAC One Node correctly. 
The agent displays Instance Status as "INACTIVE", and Instance Name as "*" 
within the RDB Active Instance attribute group in a RAC One Node 
cluster environment.

6.3.1-TIV-ITM_KRZ-IF0001
----------------------------------------------------

Enhancement: MR0329054818
Abstract: Add Host name, Instance name, and Database name to all Oracle
attribute groups for the ITCAM Extended Agent for Oracle Database version
6.3.
Additional Information: With this enhancement, the situation provides more
detailed information. The Oracle Database Extended agent also provides
this information in a combined string. 
The IT administrator can set up the situation easily.

The following attribute groups were changed:
KRZ_DATABASE_INFORMATION
KRZ_AGENT_LISTENER
KRZ_RDB_ALERT_LOG_SUMMARY
KRZ_RDB_ALERT_LOG_DETAILS
KRZ_RDB_TABLESPACE_OVERVIEW
KRZ_RDB_TSFILE_METRIC

5.1 Before installing the fix
-----------------------------
- The prerequisites listed under section 3.1 entitled 'Upgrade prerequisites 
for this fix' must be installed when upgrading.

- For the purpose of this README, the <CANDLEHOME> symbol is the 
IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory. The default value
for CANDLEHOME is '/opt/IBM/ITM' on UNIX systems and 'C:\ibm\itm'
on Windows systems.

- If you have customized the Extended Monitoring Agent for Oracle 
rz.ini file on a UNIX system, back up this file before installing the fix. 
After this fix is installed, edit the latest rz.ini file and merge 
your modifications into this rz.ini file.


5.2 Local agent install and update (including silent installation)
--------------------------------------------------------------
1. Transfer the appropriate archive file to a 
temporary directory on the system that contains the agent code to be 
updated. For the purpose of this README, the <TEMP> symbol represents 
the fully qualified path to this directory.
Note: On Windows systems, this path includes the drive letter. 

2. Expand the archive file by using the tar command on UNIX systems or 
an unzip utility on Windows systems. This expansion creates a directory 
structure that contains fixes for all supported platforms.

3. Use the procedures in the "IBM Tivoli Monitoring, Version 6.2.2
Installation and Setup Guide" to install the agent.

4. Use the procedures in the specific database monitoring agent user's
guide to complete the installation and configuration.


5.3 Remote agent update and installation
----------------------------------------
1. Make sure that all potential targets of the remote deployment are
running version 6.2.2 Fix Pack 2 or later of the OS monitoring 
agent.
2. Transfer the appropriate archive file to 
a temporary directory on the Tivoli Enterprise 
Monitoring Server system. For the purpose of this README, the 
<TEMP> symbol represents the fully qualified path to this directory.
Note: On Windows systems, this path includes the drive letter. 

3. Expand the archive file by using the tar command on UNIX systems or an 
unzip utility on Windows systems. This expansion creates a directory structure
that contains fixes for all supported operating systems.

4. To add the fix pack bundles to the remote deployment depot, use the
tacmd addBundles command found in $CANDLEHOME/bin on UNIX systems
or in %CANDLE_HOME%\bin on Windows systems. For more information
about the tacmd addBundles command, see the "IBM Tivoli
Monitoring Command Reference."

On a UNIX system: if the fix was expanded to 
<TEMP>/<PARTNUMBER>:
> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>/<PARTNUMBER>/WINDOWS/Deploy -t rz -f
> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>/<PARTNUMBER>/WIA64/Deploy -t rz -f
> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>/<PARTNUMBER>/unix -t rz -f 

where:
-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to be
added to the depot.
-t is the product code of the product to add, in this case rz 
represents the Extended Monitoring Agent for Oracle Database
-f performs the actions without asking for confirmation

On a Windows system: if the fix was expanded to 
<TEMP>/<PARTNUMBER>:
> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>\<PARTNUMBER>\WINDOWS\Deploy -t rz -f
> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>\<PARTNUMBER>\WIA64\Deploy -t rz -f
> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>\<PARTNUMBER>\unix -t rz -f 

where:
-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to be
added to the depot. 
-t is the product code of the product to add, in this case rz 
represents the Extended Monitoring Agent for Oracle Database
-f performs the actions without asking for confirmation

5. To login to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring server and deploy
the fix to the appropriate nodes where the agent is running, use
the following tacmd commands. For more information about the
tacmd login and updateAgent commands, see the "IBM Tivoli
Monitoring Command Reference."

On a UNIX system: 
> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>
-u <itmuser> 
-p <password>

> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems

The output shows the managed system name for the OS agent on the 
remote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the
tacmd updateAgent command. 

> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd updateAgent -t rz
-n <Managed system name>
-v 063102000

On a Windows system:
> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd login -s <server>
-u <itmuser> 
-p <password>

> %CANDLE_HOME%/bin/tacmd listSystems

The output shows the managed system name for the OS agent on the 
remote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the
tacmd updateAgent command. 

> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd updateAgent -t RZ
-n <Managed system name>
-v 063102000
Note:
- The component (-t) for the updateAgent command is specified as 
two characters (rz), not three characters (krz).
- The node (-n) for the updateAgent command is the managed system
name of the operating system (OS) agent to be updated. The 
target node for an updateAgent command is always an OS agent.

- The following error might occur with the updateAgent command on 
Linux and UNIX endpoints; however, the agent is successfully 
updated. This error does not occur on Windows endpoints.

KUICUA011I: Updating the rz agents.
KUICUA015E: The updateAgent command did not complete because an
error occurred. Refer to the following error
returned from the server:

The monitoring server encountered an error while updating the
managed system type.

The kuiras1.log file might provide more information about 
this error. If you require further assistance to resolve the 
error, contact IBM Software Support.

A timeout occurred while waiting for an agent task to complete on
{node name}.

The agent task did not complete within the configured 
time out period.

Verify that the target system is online. Increase the 
time out value and try the operation again.



5.4 Agent support update
------------------------
Fix 6.3.1-TIV-ITM_EXT-FP0001 included changes to the agent
support files that must be installed. If you have already
installed these updates, there are no additional installation
steps. Otherwise, use the following steps to update the Tivoli
Enterprise Monitoring Server, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, or
Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop.

1. Transfer the appropriate archive file 
to the IBM Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Servers, IBM Tivoli
Enterprise Portal Servers, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal desktops. 

2. Expand the archive file using the tar command on UNIX systems or an 
unzip utility on Windows systems. 

3. Use the procedures in the "IBM Tivoli Monitoring, Version 6.2.2
Installation and Setup Guide."

4. Use the procedures in the specific database monitoring agent user's
guide to complete the installation and configuration.

5. If the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server being updated is remote (not a 
Hub Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server) then restart the Tivoli Enterprise 
Monitoring Server.


6.0 Additional installation information
========================================

6.1 Verifying the update
------------------------
1. To verify that the agent was updated correctly, use the tacmd command to 
view the current version of the agent. You are required to log in 
to a Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server before you view the agent
version. 

For example:
On a UNIX system, where $CANDLEHOME is the IBM Tivoli Monitoring
installation directory, the default location is '/opt/IBM/ITM'. 

> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>
-u <itmuser> 
-p <password>
> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems -t rz

On a Windows system, where %CANDLE_HOME% is the IBM Tivoli
Monitoring installation directory, the default location
is 'C:\ibm\itm'. 

> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd login -s <server>
-u <itmuser> 
-p <password>
> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd listSystems -t RZ 

When the agent update is successful, the agent version is 
06.31.02.00

Note:
The component (-t) for the tacmd listSystems command is specified 
as two characters (RZ), not three characters (KRZ).

2. To verify that the agent support files were updated correctly, use 
the kincinfo command on Windows systems or the cinfo command on Linux
or UNIX systems to dump the component versions on each of the 
following systems: Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring
Server, and Tivoli Enterprise Portal desktop. 

Note: 
The kincinfo and cinfo command output examples in the sections
that follow show all components that can be updated. If you do
not have all of these components installed, components that 
are not installed are not displayed in the output of these commands. 


Sample output for the cinfo command on a UNIX or Linux systems
--------------------------------------------------------------
To validate that all components are installed, run the
following command:

./cinfo

This command provides four options on the CINFO menu shown in
the example that follows. Choose the option that meets your requirements.

7.0 Known problems and workarounds
==================================
- Problem: Oracle agent unable to logon to oracle database, due to
invalid password, after remote deploying or remote 
configuring, on a windows x64 system.
defect: 119668
Workaround: Upgrade the Windows OS agent to version 6.22 fp2.

- Problem: Oracle agent running processes not stopped, after removing
the oracle agent instance from the tivoli enterprise 
monitoring services management window, on a UNIX system.
defect: 120864
Workaround: Stop the Oracle Database Extended agent instance before removing it.

- Problem: A connection of oracle agent not displayed on TEP, if the 
connection name is too long.
defect: 121337
Workaround: Assign a short name to the Oracle Database Extended agent instance and 
connection in the instance to avoid truncating the unique name(connection 
name + krz instance name + host name).

- Problem: Unable to remote deploy oracle agent to a windows IA64 
system, if no WINNT platform bundle exists in the TEMS 
repository.
defect: 122095
Workaround: Add the 3 Windows operating system bundles (WINNT, WIX64, WIA64) to
The Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server repository before remotely deploying 
on a Windows IA64 system.

- Problem: Alert logs is not displaying customized message ID.
- Workaround: If you must monitor custom message IDs in Alert logs,
message IDs must be specified in the 
installdir/config/<host>_rz_<inst>_msgid.properties file
and you must restart the agent to display it in the portal.

- Problem: default value for "Last Execution Error Code" is displaying as 0
in workspace "Customized SQLs->RDB Customized SQL Summary status".
- Workaround: The customized SQLs are not executed during agent startup
by default. These SQLs are executed only if there is a situation or 
you click "Link to SQL Result" in the workspace "Customized SQLs ->
RDB Customized SQL Summary Definition".

- Problem: agent environment variable or error trace level do not take
effective.
- Workaround: If you must edit an environment variable such as setting a new
error trace level, the new variable must be modified in both the 
installdir/config/rz.ini file and the installdir/config/rz_<instance>.config
file, and you must restart agent.

- Problem: agent report ORA-00942 error message in the log files like
following. Oracle Database Server is 10.1.0.2.
ERROR at line 1:
ORA-00942: table or view does not exist
ORA-06512: at line 128
- Workaround: Run the krzgrant.sql script in 6.3.1-TIV-ITM_KRZ-FP0001 to resolve
this error.

- Problem: tacmd listsystems command does not display proper version
for offline agent's subnode.
For subnode e.g. RZ:HOSTNAME-INSTANCE-CONNECTION:RDB, version is
displaying as 06.31.01.XX, Status is 'N'.
- Workaround: Check the version from the root node of the agent to get the correct
version, for example, for INSTANCE:HOSTNAME:RZ, the version is displayed as 
06.31.01.00. 

- Problem: After upgrading to Fix Pack 2 and configuring the Oracle
Database Extended agent silently, the agent cannot
connect to the database, which is specified by the
KRZ_CONN_STR parameter in the silent configuration
response file.
- Workaround: The KRZ_CONN_TYPE parameter specifies the connection
type. The Advanced type is required to configure a
database connection with the KRZ_CONN_STR
connection string. For example:

KRZ_CONN_STR.connection=//host:port/service
KRZ_CONN_TYPE.connection=Advanced

To solve the problem, update the silent configuration
response file to specify the KRZ_CONN_TYPE parameter and
reconfigure the agent instance silently. For example:

# cat /tmp/silent_config.txt
############ PRIMARY TEMS CONFIGURATION ############
CMSCONNECT=YES
HOSTNAME=tivp055.cn.ibm.com
NETWORKPROTOCOL=ip.pipe
IPPIPEPORTNUMBER=1918
############ Database connection config ############
INSTANCE=inst1
KRZ_CONN_USERID=tivoli
KRZ_CONN_PASSWORD=password
KRZ_INSTANT_CLIENT_LIBPATH=/opt/IBM/oci
KRZ_DYNAMIC_LISTENER=FALSE
###
KRZ_CONN_STR.asm=//tivx010:1521/+ASM
KRZ_CONN_USERID.asm=sys
KRZ_CONN_PASSWORD.asm=oracle
KRZ_CONN_MODE.asm=SYSDBA
KRZ_CONN_TYPE.asm=Advanced

# /opt/IBM/ITM/bin/itmcmd config -A -o inst1
-p /tmp/silent_config.txt rz

- Problem: The Oracle Database Extended agent reports the error
message ORA-03135: connection lost contact and the
subnode that represents the monitored database
connection is still offline in the Tivoli Enterprise Portal
after the monitored database recovers to active status..
- Workaround: The Oracle Database might disconnect all active connections
and reject new connections under certain circumstances.
An example is when resources such as CPU are exhausted
in the Oracle Server.
To solve the problem, ensure that the Oracle Database
and Oracle Listener are open to the new connection and
restart the agent instance.

- Problem: After you upgrade to V6.3.1 Fix Pack 2, the subnode ID
is truncated from 25 characters to 24 characters. The
original subnode with 25 characters changes to gray, and
the new subnode with 24 characters is displayed.
- Workaround: This behavior is expected. In 6.3.1-TIV-ITM_KRZ-IF0001
or later versions, the agent changed the maximum
subnode ID from 25 characters to 24 characters to avoid
the following problem, which is a known APAR for IBM
Tivoli Monitoring V6.2.2 Fix Pack 4: "pure event cannot
fire when subnode name length is equal to or greater
than 32 characters."
To avoid truncation of the subnode from 25 characters to
24 characters, use one of the following two options:

Option 1: Set the following variable to a value of 25 in
the agent environment variable files:
KRZ_MAX_SUBNODE_ID_LENGTH=25. After you upgrade,
the default value is 24.
Note:
- On UNIX or Linux operating systems, the
environment variable files include
installdir/config/rz.ini and installdir/config/
rz_instance.config.
- On Windows operating systems, the environment
variable files include installdir\TMAITM6\
KRZENV_instance (32-bit) or installdir\
TMAITM6_X64\KRZENV_instance (64-bit).

Option 2: Reduce the length of the database
connection name, agent instance name, or host name;
or, see Changing default naming conventions for
database connections in the Installation and
Configuration Guide for the Oracle Database Extended
agent for information.

 IBM How to delete a document hierarchy node in IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture - United States dco document hierarchy node delete remove hide blank page TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I delete a document hierarchy node, such as a blank page, so that it no longer processes rules or appears in a batchview listing? 

CAUSE
It is sometimes desired to remove pages or documents from a batch, as they are no longer needed or to simplify processing for a Verify operator.

ANSWER
The DeleteChildType from the Validations library can be used by running it from the parent of the object to be deleted and specifying the specific child. 

For example, to remove blank pages from a batch: 

 1. Create a special page type attached at the batch level called something like DeleteMe. 
 2. Use an action like BlankPagesIDBySize to identify the blank page:  * BlankPagesIDBySize (1000,DeleteMe)
    
    
 3. Create a rule with the action DeleteChildType(DeleteMe) and attach it at the batch level to have it remove all pages with page type DeleteMe.


If building a custom action, the DeleteChild API method is invoked from the parent object.

 IBM Purging the connection pool of a WebSphere Application Server data source using the data source MBean - United States was app server TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 During the testing or troubleshooting of an enterprise application, it may become necessary to purge the connection pool of a WebSphere Application Server data source of existing connections. 

SYMPTOM
Changes to the application or environment may invalidate cached connections in the Connection Manager pool. Although these connections will eventually be discarded through the normal processing of the connection requests, it may be desirable to purge them all at once and allow the pool to refill with new, valid connections.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
WebSphere Application Server has an operation on the data source MBean that can be used to purge the connection pool. WebSphere Application Server MBean may be called via the wsadmin console, see the IBM Information Center topic "Scripting the application serving environment (wsadmin)" for more details. The operation name is: purgePoolContents. 

The purgePoolContents operation has two options: 

 1. Normal:  * This is the default option. 
     * Existing in-flight transactions will be allowed to continue work. 
     * Shared connection requests will be honored. 
     * Free connections are cleaned up and destroyed. 
     * In use connections (for example: connections in transactions) are cleaned up and destroyed when returned to the connection pool. 
     * A close() call issued on any connection obtained prior to the purgePoolContents will be done synchronously (for example: wait for the jdbc driver to return before proceeding). 
     * Requests for new connections (not handles to existing old connections) will be honored.
       
       
    
    
 2. Immediate:  * No new transactions will be allowed to start on any connections obtained prior to the purgePoolContents call. Instead, a StaleConnectionException is thrown. 
     * No new handles will be handed out on any connections obtained prior to the purgePoolContents call. Instead, a StaleConnectionException is thrown. 
     * Existing in-flight transactions will be allowed to continue work. Any new activities on a purged Connection will cause a StaleConnectionException or an XAER_FAIL exception (in the case of XA) 
     * A close() call issued on any connection obtained prior to the purgePoolContents call will be done asynchronously (for example: no waiting for the jdbc driver to return) This is useful if the driver returns. 
     * Due to the fact that close() does not wait, the number of connections will be decremented immediately in WebSphere Application Server. This might cause the total number of connections in WebSphere Application Server to be temporarily out of sync with the database total number of connections. 
     * Requests for new connections (for example: not handles to existing old connections) will be honored.
    
    


Examples of operations that can be executed on the data source MBean using the wasdmin console:  1. List all data sources:
    Using Jacl:
    $AdminControl queryNames *:type=DataSource,*
    
    Using Jython:
    AdminControl.queryNames("*:type=DataSource,*")
    
    
 2. Initialize a variable to specify a data source (this example uses Default Datasource, but any data source name listed in the output of above command can be used):
    Using Jacl:
    set name "Default Datasource"
    set ds [$AdminControl queryNames *:type=DataSource,name=$name,*] 
    
    Using Jython:
    name = "Default Datasource"
    ds = AdminControl.queryNames("*:type=DataSource,name="+name+",*") 
    
    
 3. View the pool contents by invoking the showPoolContents operation of the data source MBean:
    Using Jacl:
    $AdminControl invoke $ds showPoolContents
    
    Using Jython:
    print AdminControl.invoke(ds, "showPoolContents")
    
    
 4. View contents of all pools by invoking the showAllPoolContents operation of the data source MBean:
    Using Jacl:
    $AdminControl invoke $ds showAllPoolContents
    
    
    Using Jython:
    print AdminControl.invoke(ds, "showAllPoolContents")
    
    
 5. Immediately purge the pool by invoking the purgePoolContents operation of the data source MBean with the immediate option:
    Using Jacl:
    $AdminControl invoke $ds purgePoolContents immediate
    
    
    Using Jython:
    AdminControl.invoke(ds, "purgePoolContents", "immediate")
    
    

If the purge operation is successful, no response will be observed. If the purge operation is not successful, the response will indicate a possible reason for failure. One common reason for failure is attempting to purge the contents of a connection pool which is not yet available (the connection pool is not created until a naming look-up of the associated datasource or connection factory occurs), resulting in an illegal state exception.

=====================================================
The following problems are addressed by this interim fix.

2.1 APARs
---------- 

APAR: IV63525
Abstract: CUSTOMER IS GETTING 0 ENTRIES FOR THE OUTPUT OF THE 
FUNCTION MODULE /IBMMON/ITM_QOUT_GET_QUEUES.
Additional Information: The /IBMMON/ITM_QOUT_GET_QUEUES function 
module stopped collecting the data even though the data was 
present in the SAP system. Due to this, SYSID ‘+++’ was 
displayed on the Tivoli Enterprise Portal. The function module
has been rectified for collecting the data from the SAP 
systems having versions greater than 46C and SP level 
SPKB46C39.

APAR: IV60733
Abstract: MPS CX_SY_CONVERSION_NO_NUMBER IN FUNCTION MODULE
IBMMON/ITM_FILE_SYSTEM
Additional Information: ABAP dump ‘Conversion Error –unable to 
handle‘---‘ as a number ’ for the / IBMMON/ITM_FILE_SYSTEM
function module is gracefully handled towards File Systems 
attribute group.

2.2 Defects
------------

Defect: 58382 
Abstract: Exception condition "GWY_COMMUNICATION_FAILURE" raised.
Additional Information: "GWY_COMMUNICATION_FAILURE" has been 
gracefully handled for the /IBMMON/ITM_GWY_CONNECTIONS 
function module towards the Gateway Connections attribute 
group.

Defect: 55733
Abstract: TEP Remote configuration of SAP Agent is not working on 
non-windows after remote upgrade.
Additional Information: While getting the Config parameters from the
".cfg" file, the two parameters for gateway are removed from 
the parameters that are being sent to the Tivoli Enterprise 
Portal Configuration Panel. Also the ".cfg" file is updated 
by removing those parameters. Then, reconfiguration of Agent 
Instance with appserver and logon mode through Tivoli 
Enterprise Portal is successful after remote upgradation to
711FP1 IF1.

Defect: 55366
Abstract: ABAP Dumps when Job Name is not present in SAP standard
table.
Additional Information: Exception handling was missing for the
scenario of the Job Name not being present in the SAP standard
table. The issue has been fixed by adding the required 
exception handling for Workspace Integration engine background
jobs when Job is not present in SAP.


2.3 Enhancements
----------------

Enhancement: 67334
Abstract: Additional functionality to handle the MAI missing Alerts 
in the Function Module /IBMMON/ITM_MAIALRT_INX. 
Additional Information: Function module /IBMMON/ITM_MAIALRT_INX is 
modified to fetch the MAI Alerts which are missed by ITM SAP
Agent as these MAI Alerts are inserted into table 
/IBMMON/ITM_ALIX with some delay by SAP.
Note: 
1) SAP system time and ITCAM SAP Agent machine time should be
in sync upto accuracy of seconds.
2) In order to have full collection of MAI Alerts, there is 
an additional overlap time being added to the sampling time 
frequency given by the ITCAM SAP Agent.
This additional overlap time is configurable parameter on 
the SAP side
Please note -
a)By default the additional overlap time will be 1 min i.e. 
60 seconds. 
b)Maximum additional overlap time which can be configured 
will be 5 mins i.e. 300 seconds. 
c)If the user wants the additional overlap time greater than
1 min i.e. 60 seconds and less than or equal to 5mins i.e.
300 mins, then he should follow the below steps.

Please find below the steps to configure this additional 
overlap time on SAP side:
• Go to transaction code SE16.
• Enter the table name as '/IBMMON/ITM_CNFG' and press 'F7'.
• Execute the database table '/IBMMON/ITM_CNFG' or press 'F8'.
• Add the additional overlap time parameter as ‘MAI_PERD_OV’
in the database field 'ITM Configuration Parameters' and 
then add the additional overlap time in seconds in the 
database field 'VALUE_INT' and save it.

Abstract: TEPS DISPLAYS ALERT TIMESTAMP AS UTC 
Additional Information: MAI Alerts stored in the database table
'/IBMMON/ITM_ALIX' are in the UTC format.So while fetching 
such MAI Alerts, conversion from UTC time zone to current 
system time zone is required.

APAR: IV60254
Abstract: 'TRANSACTION PERFORMANCE' AND 'R/3 TRANSACTION PERFORMANCE'

5.0 Installation instructions 
=============================

This fix can only be installed over an existing installation of
711 FP0001. Use the following steps to install this fix.

5.1 Before installing the fix 
-----------------------------
- The prerequisites listed under section 3.1 entitled 'Upgrade 
Prerequisites for this fix' must be installed when for upgrade.

- For the purpose of this README, the <CANDLEHOME> symbol is the 
IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory. The default value
for CANDLEHOME is '/opt/IBM/ITM' on UNIX systems and 'C:\IBM\ITM'
on Windows systems.

- Before installing this interim fix on UNIX systems, set the CANDLEHOME 
environment variable to the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation
directory.

For example: 
> CANDLEHOME=/opt/IBM/ITM
> export CANDLEHOME

- Because there is no uninstall utility for this interim fix, be sure to
perform a backup of your environment before installing this fix.

5.2 Local agent update
--------------------------
1. Transfer the appropriate archive file
(7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001.tar or .zip) to a temporary
directory on the system that contains the agent to be updated.
For the purpose of this README, the <TEMP> symbol represents the
fully qualified path to this directory. Note: On Windows systems,
this path includes the drive letter.

2. Expand the archive file using the "tar" command on UNIX systems
or an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a
directory structure that contains fixes for all supported
operating systems.

3. Use the "itmpatch" command to install the fix for the operating
system for that agent. For more information on the "itmpatch" 
command, see section [6.2]. 

On UNIX systems, if the fix was expanded to 
<TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001, the install command is:

> <TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001/itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> 
-i <TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001/ksa_xxxxxx_tema_if0001.tar

where:
- xxxxxx corresponds to the value in the first column 
returned by the ./cinfo -i command. 

In the following example, the file is 
"ksa_li6263_tema_if0001.tar".
> ./cinfo -i
[Monitoring Agent for Your Product]
[lx8266 Version: 07.11.01.01] 

On Windows systems, if the fix was expanded to 
<TEMP>\7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001, the install command is:

For Windows 32-bit
> <TEMP>\7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001\itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> 
-i <TEMP>\7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001\ksa_winnt_tema_if0001.cab

For Windows 64-bit 
> <TEMP>\7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001\itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> 
-i <TEMP>\7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001\ksa_wix64_tema_if0001.cab

Note: if the itmpatch command gets this error:
"The application has failed to start because its side-by-side
configuration is incorrect. Please see the application event
log for more detail." it's necessary install the "visualstudio
redistribution package" before to run the itmpatch command.

For a 32bit architecture,
the name of this package is vcredist_x86.exe, available at
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5582 [http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5582]

For a 64bit architecture,
the name of this package is vcredist_x64.exe,available at 
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=2092 [http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=2092]


5.3 Remote agent update
----------------------------
1. Transfer the appropriate archive file 
(7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001.tar or .zip) to a temporary
directory on the IBM Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server system.
For the purpose of this README, the <TEMP> symbol represents the
fully qualified path to this directory. Note: On Windows systems,
this path includes the drive letter.

2. Expand the archive file using the "tar" command on UNIX systems 
or an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a 
directory structure that contains fixes for all of the supported
operating systems.

3. To add the agent fix bundles into the remote deploy depot, use
the "tacmd addBundles" command found in $CANDLEHOME/bin on UNIX
systems or in %CANDLE_HOME%\bin on Windows systems. For more 
information on the "tacmd addBundles" command, see the IBM Tivoli
Monitoring Command Reference.

On UNIX systems, 
if the fix was expanded to <TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001:
> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd addBundles -n -i 
<TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001 

On Windows systems, 
if the fix was expanded to <TEMP>\7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001:
> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd addBundles -n -i 
<TEMP>\7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001 

where:
-n indicates that prerequisite bundles are not automatically
added. The -n parameter must be used because the fix 
directory does not contain any prerequisites that the fix
might require. See Section 3.1 for the prerequisites
for this fix.
-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to be
added to the depot. 

4. After "tacmd addBundles.." from step 3 above, control files
on the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server and the
Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server must be updated.
These updates must be done manually.

a. Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server update
The sa_dd_07110101.xml and sa_dd.properties files must be
copied from the <TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001
directory to the 071001000 version of the Tivoli Enterprise
Monitoring Services depot.

Two scripts are provided to make these copies and are 
in the fix <TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001 directory
after the expansion of the tar or zip file:

ksa_patchdepot.bat - Windows
ksa_patchdepot.sh - UNIX

From the <TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001 directory,
run the appropriate script based on the operating system. The
script output contains details about the copies being made.

b. Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server update
Resource files must be copied from the
<TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001 directory to the
Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Portal directory.

Two scripts are provided to make these copies and are 
in the fix <TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001 directory
after the expansion of the tar or zip file:

ksa_patch_resource_teps.bat - Windows
ksa_patch_resource_teps.sh - UNIX

From the <TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001 directory,
run the appropriate script based on the operating system. The 
script output contains details about the copies being made.

5. To log in to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring server, and deploy
the fix to the appropriate nodes where the agent is running, use
the following "tacmd" commands. For more information on the 
"tacmd login" and "tacmd updateAgent" commands, see the IBM 
Tivoli Monitoring Command Reference.

On UNIX systems: 
> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>
-u <itmuser> 
-p <password>

> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems

The output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the
remote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the
"tacmd updateAgent" command.

> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd updateAgent -t sa 
-n <Managed system name>
-v 07110101

On Windows systems:
> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd login -s <server>
-u <itmuser> 
-p <password>

> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd listSystems

The output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the
remote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the
"tacmd updateAgent" command.

> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd updateAgent -t sa 
-n <Managed system name> 
-v 07110101

Note:
- The component (-t) for the "tacmd updateAgent" command is 
specified as two characters (sa), not three characters (ksa).
- The node (-n) for the "tacmd updateAgent" command is the 
managed system name of the operating system (OS) agent to be 
updated. The target node for the "tacmd updateAgent" command 
is always an OS agent.

5.4 Agent support update
------------------------------
Use the following steps to update the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring
Server, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal
Desktop. 
Note: If SDA feature is enable at the HUB TEMS, then below steps are
are not required. SDA will install only browser support and if
customer is using TEP Desktop then install the support manfully
as shown below.

This fix (7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001) includes changes to the
agent support files that must be installed. If you installed these
updates, there are no additional installation steps. If you did not
install these updates, use the following steps to update the Tivoli
Enterprise Monitoring Server, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, or
Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop.

1. Transfer the appropriate archive file
7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001.tar or .zip) to the Tivoli
Enterprise Monitoring Servers, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Servers,
or Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktops. 

2. Expand the archive file using the "tar" command on UNIX systems
or an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a 
directory structure that contains fixes for all of the supported
platforms.

3. Expand the archive file (ksa_tems_teps_tepd_if0001.tar or .zip)
that contains the updates for the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring 
Server, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, and Tivoli Enterprise 
Portal Desktop using the "tar" command on UNIX systems or an 
extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a directory
structure that includes a subdirectory called CD-ROM, with the
necessary updates.

4. Use the Application Support Installer(ASI) GUI or the silent
installation method to install the application support files. 

GUI installation option
------------------------
The GUI can be started by using one of the following commands
from within the CD-ROM directory where setup.jar is located. 

On UNIX systems:
> ./itmasi.sh [-h <CANDLEHOME>] [-j <JAVAHOME>] 

On Windows systems:
> itmasi [-h <CANDLEHOME>] [-j <JAVAHOME>] 

When prompted by the Application Support Installer for the 
installable media directory, select the CD-ROM directory, not the
component directory. The installer can install updates for 
multiple components at the same time.

Note: For IBM Tivoli Monitoring Version 6.3 or above, one 
of the following additional steps must be performed.

1. Aquire a platform-specific pre-packaged JRE version 
of the Application Support Installer (ASI). See IBM 
Tivoli Monitoring Application Support Installer, 
6.2-tiv-itm_asi-if0002 at 
http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034924 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034924]
for download and installation instructions.

2. Specify the '-j javahome' parameter with the path to 
a 32-bit java(r) 1.5 or java 1.6 installation when running 
the itmasi.sh or itmasi.bat script described below. 

5. The next panel presented by the Application Support Installer 
asks for the selection of Tivoli Monitoring components to which 
you want to add application support. For this fix, check or 
clear the check boxes as follows:

[checked | unchecked] - Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server (TEMS)
[checked | unchecked] - Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server (TEPS)
[checked | unchecked] - Tivoli Enterprise Desktop Client (TEPD)

Continue through the remaining GUI panels selecting SAP Agent
07.11.01.01 support to complete the installation.

6. If the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop or Tivoli Enterprise 
Portal Browser was running when the update was installed, it must
be restarted.

7. If the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server being updated is remote
(not a Hub Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server) then restart the 
Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server.

5.5 Installing SAP agent transport
------------------------------------
Note: From this fix onwards,a single ITM file has been provided for
importing SAP transport on all supported SAP versions having BADI or
non-BADI implementation.

This procedure installs the SAP transport into the SAP system. You
are not required to uninstall the previous transport before
installing this transport.

1. Go to the ABAP directory in the location where you expanded the
fix archive file.

2. Copy the transport files into the SAP environment as follows: 

a. The following two sets of transport files are in the 
ABAP directory of the SAP agent fix archive:

1) K711_00103U.ITM and R711_00103U.ITM in /ABAP directory.
These files are Unicode versions of the transport. 

2) K711_00103_DELETE.ITM and R711_00103_DELETE.ITM
These transport files remove the ABAP code. Do not import
the DELETE transport unless you stop using the product 
entirely and want to remove the transports from your SAP
systems.

b. Copy your transport files to the SAP Transport System data
directory as follows:

1) Copy the K711_00103U.ITM file to the cofiles directory.
2) Copy the R711_00103U.ITM file to the data directory.

3. Run the following command for non-BADI and BADI where:
SID Target SAP : system ID
PROFILE_NAME : Name of the tp profile file
nnn : Number for the target client where the agent is to run

tp addtobuffer ITMK711_00103U SID
pf=\usr\sap\trans\bin\PROFILE_NAME
tp import ITMK711_00103U SID client=nnn U16
pf=\usr\sap\trans\bin\PROFILE_NAME


Alternately, you can use the SAP STMS transaction to import the
transport requests. Ensure that the Import Transport Request Again 
and the Overwrite Objects in Unconfirmed Repairs options are 
checked on the Import Options tab of the Import Transport Request
window.

where:

-h Specifies the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory
-i Specifies the path to the directory or patch file to be installed
-t Generates a report of the actions to be taken by the patch

For example, on UNIX systems:
- To preview the fix installation, use the "-t" option:
> <CANDLEHOME>/bin/itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> -t <TEMP>

- To install the fix, use the "-i" option:
> <CANDLEHOME>/bin/itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> -i <TEMP>

where: 
<CANDLEHOME> is the fully qualified IBM Tivoli Monitoring 
installation directory. On Windows systems, this path must include
the drive letter.
<TEMP> represents the fully qualified directory specification, 
where the fix is located. On Windows systems, this path must 
include the drive letter.

6.3 Verifying the update
------------------------
1. To verify that the agent was updated correctly, use the tacmd
command to view the current version of the agent after the agent
is restarted. You are required to log in to a Tivoli Enterprise
Monitoring Server before viewing the agent version.

For example:
On UNIX systems, where $CANDLEHOME is the IBM Tivoli Monitoring
installation directory. The default location is '/opt/IBM/ITM'.

> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>
-u <itmuser>
-p <password>
> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems -t sa

On Windows systems, where %CANDLE_HOME% is the IBM Tivoli
Monitoring installation directory. The default location
is 'C:\IBM\ITM'.

> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd login -s <server>
-u <itmuser>
-p <password>

> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd listSystems -t sa

Note:
- The component (-t) for the tacmd listSystems command is
specified as two characters (sa), not three characters (ksa).

When the agent update is successful, the agent version is 
07.11.01.01

Note:
- The component (-t) for the tacmd listSystems command is
specified as two characters (sa), not three characters (ksa).

When the agent update is successful, the agent version is 
07.11.01.01

After the agent is restarted, you can also use the GUI to verify
that the agent was successfully updated.

For the agent on Windows systems, the version number is
07.11.01.01
For the agent on UNIX systems, the version number is
07.11.01.01

2. To verify that the agent support files were updated correctly,
use the kincinfo command on Windows systems or the cinfo command
on Linux(R) or UNIX systems. The sample output below shows the
versions of the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, Tivoli Enterprise
Monitoring Server, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop systems 
after this fix has been successfully applied.

Note:
- The date of the build displayed might not be accurate. This is
a known problem.

On Linux systems:
--------------------
To validate that all components have been installed, run the
following command:

For example: 
> %CANDLE_HOME%/bin/cinfo -i

Note: cinfo output may differ depending on ITM version.

7.0 Known problems and workarounds
===================================

Abstract: While configuring the agent instance on UNIX, more than 3 
letters are accepted as instance ID. 
Problem: Three letters are accepted as Instance ID while configuring 
agent instance on UNIX. This can result in failure to connect
to the SAP system as the ".cfg" file for that instance will
be generated with a wrong name.
Workaround:
The user should make sure that only three lettered name is 
entered as the instance ID while configuring an agent instance. 


8.0 Additional product information
==================================

ABAP Transport Compatibility:
------------------------------
Each fix includes an updated agent executable
program (ksaagent or ksaagent.exe) and an updated ABAP transport.
Install both programs to obtain the highest level of support.

In some situations, you cannot install
a new transport immediately because of change control processes on the
mySAP systems. In these situations, sometimes you can run a new agent
executable with a prior version of the ABAP transport. This section 
explains when it is possible to run a newer agent executable program
with an older version of an ABAP transport.

Note: The mySAP agent does not run correctly if not installed with
a compatible level of the transport.

 IBM Datacap Rulerunner server stops after several aborted batches - United States Rulerunner hang stop abort TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After several batches abort consecutively in Rulerunner, all threads shut down. 

CAUSE
Rulerunner has a thread control feature that acts as a safety to prevent all pending batches from aborting. When it detects a certain number of consecutively aborted batches on a single thread, Rulerunner shuts down all threads. By default, the threshold is three batches, so shutdown occurs if four batches abort consecutively.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
With Rulerunner logging turned on, aborting batches will show in the rulerunnerX.log files (where X is the thread number. If there is a question as to whether a Rulerunner shutdown is being caused by this feature, check the rulerunnerX logs for each thread to see if there are four consecutive aborts followed by a shutdown.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If there is a need to change this behavior due to situations where a large number of batches might legitimately abort, the threshold can be increased or the feature can be turned off through the following registry keys.


x86 (32-bit) OS: 

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Datacap\Rulerunner\Misc (REG_DWORD) Restart
Individual processors [default: 1] 

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Datacap\Rulerunner\Misc (REG_DWORD) Restart
processor Attempts [default: 3] 

 

x64 (64-bit) OS: 

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Datacap\Rulerunner\Misc
(REG_DWORD) Restart Individual processors [default: 1) 

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Datacap\Rulerunner\Misc
(REG_DWORD) Restart processor Attempts [default: 3] 

 

 * Restart Individual processors - 1 is on, 0 is off. 
 * Restart processor Attempts - Number of times Rulerunner will move to the next batch without shutting down the threads after a series of batches abort.

 IBM Changes in the default user identifier between WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 classes for JMS and WebSphere MQ V7.1 classes for JMS - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 You have configured a WebSphere Application Server WebSphere MQ messaging provider connection factory without an Authentication Alias and do not programmatically supply user identifier information when creating a connection to a queue manager. You notice a change in the default behaviour between WebSphere Application Server versions regarding the user identifier flowed on the MQCONN to the target WebSphere MQ Queue Manager:

- When using WebSphere Application Server v7.0 and v8.0, no user identifier value (blank) is passed to the queue manager. 

- When using WebSphere Application Server V8.5, a non-blank user identifier value is passed to the queue manager. 

In the latter case, you receive the following exception when creating a connection to a queue manager:

JMSCMQ0001: WebSphere MQ call failed with compcode '2' ('MQCC_FAILED') reason '2035' ('MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED') 

Is this change in behaviour expected? 

ANSWER
WebSphere MQ access control is based on user identifiers. There is a deliberate change in the default behaviour between the WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 classes for JMS and the WebSphere MQ V7.1 (and later) classes for JMS regarding the default user identifier flowed to the queue manager.
From the WebSphere MQ V7.1 classes for JMS onwards, a non-blank user identifier is always flowed to the queue manager when creating a connection to WebSphere MQ. This is true even if no user identifier has been specified, or a blank or null user identifier has been specified; for example by calling:

MQConnectionFactory.createConnection();

or:

MQConnectionFactory.createConnection(“”, “”);

or:

MQConnectionFactory.createConnection(null, null);

In the case where a null or blank user identifier has been specified, the WebSphere MQ V7.1 and later classes for JMS will query the value of the Java System Property user.name. The value of this property is flowed to the queue manager for authorization.

As a result, if the user identifier specified by the Java System Property user.name is not authorized to access the queue manager, the queue manager will return an exception to the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS with Reason Code MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED and the connection to the queue manager will not be established.

This change in behaviour could affect topologies that previously relied on the default behaviour in the WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 classes for JMS that flowed a blank user identifier when establishing a CLIENT mode transport connection. The expectation that a blank or null user identifier will be flowed by default, and that the user identifier that started the WebSphere MQ server-connection channel would be used by the queue manager when performing the authorization checks, is no longer valid from the WebSphere MQ V7.1 classes for JMS.

In the case outlined above, system administrators that are currently relying on the default behaviour of the WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 classes for JMS should review their configurations regarding the use of user identifiers and authorization. This might also help to improve security within their WebSphere MQ topology.


In summary, the change in behaviour will affect users of:

- The WebSphere MQ V7.1 and later classes for JMS.

- The WebSphere MQ V7.1 and later JCA Resource Adapter that includes the classes for JMS.

- Versions of WebSphere Application Server that include the WebSphere MQ V7.1 and later JCA Resource Adapter. Currently this is WebSphere Application Server V8.5.0.0 and later.


The com.ibm.mq.jms.ForceUserID Java System Property

A Java System Property called “com.ibm.mq.jms.ForceUserID” was introduced as part of APAR IZ49302 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IZ49302] and included from WebSphere MQ V6.0.2.8 and WebSphere MQ V7.0.1.

The changes made as part of this APAR could be used to change the default behaviour in the WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 classes for JMS regarding the user identifier value flowed to the queue manager when creating a connection.

This property is no longer valid from WebSphere MQ V7.1. Setting this property will have no affect on the WebSphere MQ V7.1 classes for JMS and later.

 IBM Specifying the profile path in the BPMConfig properties file for IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) - United States BPMConfig; profile; path; directory TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do you specify the profile path in the configuration properties file for IBM Business Process Manager so you can use it with the BPMConfig command? 

ANSWER
Note: The information that is contained in this document has been moved to dW Answers at this location [https://developer.ibm.com/answers/questions/171346/how-do-you-specify-the-profile-path-with-bpmconfig.html]. The new format will allow you to ask questions of the community to better understand the information. This technote will be archived in 60 days. Please bookmark the new location.

You can use the following property names: 

 * For a Deployment Manager profile: bpm.dmgr.profilePath 
 * For a Custom profile: bpm.de.node.#.profilePath


For example: 
bpm.dmgr.profilePath=/usr/IBM/bpm85/profiles/DmgrProfile 
bpm.de.node.1.profilePath=c:\\Program Files\\WebSphere\\profiles\\MyCustomProfile1  

For Microsoft Windows, you can use double backslashes or forward slashes. For example: 

bpm.de.node.1.profilePath=c:/Program Files/WebSphere/profiles/MyCustomProfile1 

 

Note: If you are creating the profile makes sure a profilePath value does not exist. The parent directory of the profile path should exist and the user should have write privileges to create a new directory. 


For example, if you want to create a profile under the /usr/BPM850profiles/myProfile directory. Create the/usr/BPM850profiles directory, but do not create the /usr/BPM850profiles/myProfile directory.

 IBM JMSListener AutoReconnect properties misconception - United States netcool; impact; netcool/impact; nci; jms; dsa; connectivity; reconnect; auto; autoreconnect; property; properties; listener; jmslistener; misconception; disinformation; misunderstanding; misinterpretation; error; fault; inaccuracy TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 There appears to be a common misconception regarding the application of the JMS DSA Listener properties for AutoReconnect



SYMPTOM
AutoReconnect fails


CAUSE
Properties for the JMSListener in the file: 

$NCHOME/impact/etc/[ImpactServerName]_[JMSListenerName].props

have been set as:

impact.[JMSListenerName].jms.autoreconnect=true
impact.[JMSListenerName].jms.autoreconnect.pollinterval=[TimeValue]




RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Properties for the JMSListener in the file: 


$NCHOME/impact/etc/[ImpactServerName]_[JMSListenerName].props

Where [ImpactServerName] is the name of the ImpactServer (for example: NCI) and [JMSListenerName] is the name of the JMSListener Service (for example: MyJMSListener) and the properties should be set as:

impact.[JMSListenerName].autoreconnect=true
impact.[JMSListenerName].autoreconnect.pollinterval=[TimeValue]

Where [JMSListenerName] is the name of the JMSListener Service (for example: MyJMSListener) and [TimeValue] is the desired polling interval value in milliseconds (for example: 30000 (equivalent to 30 seconds)). So, the properties are without the additional .jms bit. 

 IBM No data in some workspaces for MySQL agent - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Monitoring agent for MySQL when configured to monitor MySQL server versions 5.7.6 and above does not collect data for some of the attribute groups. 

SYMPTOM
Data does not get collected for the following views that show system and status variable related information: 

View name Workspace name Navigator group name Statistics Statistics Availability Operations per second MySQL status data Availability Session status Agent Configuration Configuration Global status Global variables Server String properties Numeric properties Following exception is seen in the JDBC trace logs: 

- JdbcConnection.executeFromList-new - java.sql.SQLException: The 'INFORMATION_SCHEMA.GLOBAL_STATUS' feature is disabled; see the documentation for 'show_compatibility_56' 

The above error is seen for MySQL versions 5.7.9 and higher. For MySQL versions prior to 5.7.9, selecting from the INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables produces an empty result set with a deprecation warning. 

 

Note: MySQL agent is packaged with ITCAM for Applications (IBM Tivoli Monitoring) and Application Performance Monitoring 8.1.x solutions.


CAUSE
Few tables in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA that are used by the agent to collect monitoring data are deprecated in the MySQL server versions 5.7.6 and above. Due to this deprecation these tables cannot be queried normally and cause an error when the agent tries to query these tables to get data.


More details about the MySQL INFORMATION_SCHEMA migration to performance_schema here: 

https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/performance-schema-variable-table-migration.html [https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/performance-schema-variable-table-migration.html]



ENVIRONMENT
MySQL agent installed on MySQL Server versions 5.7.6 and above.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Users wanting to run the agent on MySQL server versions 5.7.6 and above should use the 'show_compatibility_56' [https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html] system variable which affects whether MySQL 5.6 compatibility is enabled with respect to how system and status variable information is provided by the INFORMATION_SCHEMA. 

This variable can be set from the MySQL command prompt as: 

set global show_compatibility_56=ON; 

 

The default value of the variable 'show_compatibility_56' for MySQL server versions <=5.7.7 is ‘ON’ and for versions >=5.7.8 is ‘OFF’. 

 

User can check the value of this variable by running the following command from the MySQL command prompt: 

show global variables like "show_compatibility_56"; 

 

This variable can also be set in the MySQL server configuration file also called as Option file. 

User needs to add the following line to the ‘my.cnf’ file (located at ‘<MySQL_Installation_Dir>/my.cnf’ for Windows and ‘/etc/my.cnf’ for UNIX/Linux): 

show_compatibility_56=ON 

 

The paths mentioned above are the default paths for the Option file. For more details on where your installation of MySQL server looks for the 'my.cnf' file, refer the URL: 

https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/option-files.html [https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/option-files.html] 

 

Note: Change in 'my.cnf' file will require a MySQL server re-start for the changes to take effect. 

 

More details on the system variable 'show_compatibility_56' here: 

https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_show_compatibility_56 [https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_show_compatibility_56]

 IBM ITCAM for SOA KD4SDMS database size grows - United States CAMSOAALL CAMSOADB CAMSOAPERF REQMETRICS RESPMETRICS kd4TrimDB2db TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 As the KD4SDMS grows unbounded, is there a way to regularly prune it? 

ANSWER
Regarding the older release ITCAM for SOA 7.1.1, there is no a mechanism to automatically regularly prune the KD4SDMS database. The following Wiki page has been published on the topic:
https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/Tivoli+Composite+Application+Manager/page/Pruning+SDMS+Relationship+Metrics+Tables [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/Tivoli+Composite+Application+Manager/page/Pruning+SDMS+Relationship+Metrics+Tables]

To keep only the latest 24 hours every day (regular pruning), you can schedule a daily job to run the kd4TrimDB2db utility provided above. 

As for the newer ITCAM for SOA 7.2, there is a cleanup task that runs on the TEPS host where SDMS database is installed. It deletes REQMETRICS and RESPMETRICS table rows where SRTTIME (start of period) is more than 24 hours ago. So these two tables, which are responsible for most of KD4SDMS storage occupation, should not grow unbounded anymore.

NOTE: ITCAM for SOA 7.1.1 is Out-Of-Support since 2015 April 30.

 IBM Using Oracle JDBC driver specific properties through a datasource - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Properties directly supported by the Oracle JDBC driver that are not part of the JDBC specification cannot be used as a Custom Property in a datasource. 

CAUSE
The Oracle JDBC driver has added support for a new Custom Property under connectionProperties..

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The method used with datasources is to set a Custom Property in the datasource as follows: 

Name: connectionProperties 
Value: propertyA=valueA;propertyB=valueB


For example, if you wish to set the property oracle.jdbc.V8Compatible=true, then you would specify the following. 
Name: connectionProperties 
Value: oracle.jdbc.V8Compatible=true

Important 

Updates are required only on Servers and thick client computers. No update is required for "thin client" computers. You must upgrade all thick clients and servers to the same IBM Datacap version and feature pack. Different versions of IBM Datacap are not compatible; therefore, you cannot connect an IBM Datacap client with a server that has a different IBM Datacap server version or feature pack installed. Operating Datacap Client or Datacap Web with an incompatible version of Datacap Server, or allowing different versions to access one database, can result in loss of data. 

Once installed, this feature pack cannot be uninstalled. However, you can use "Uninstall or change a program" in Control Panel to uninstall the entire Datacap product. 

The language you selected when installing Datacap 9.0.1 determined the language displayed in the InstallShield panels at that time, and also controls the language in which the InstallShield panels for this feature pack are displayed. 

 

Alerts! 

1) When running an update, the global ruleset DLLs are updated but the copies in each application are not updated. 

As a result, new features and fixes are not applied to applications and customers might experience defects that have been fixed. 

The global ruleset DLLs are in the Datacap\RRS folder. The application copies are in the application DCO rules folder. 

Customers must manually update the ruleset DLLs in each application where they are installed. 

2) When running an update, the master task configuration files are updated (Datacap\ProgramSet) but the setting in applications are not updated (in application DCO folder). 

As a result, new features and fixes are not applied to applications and customers might experience problems that have been fixed. 

The master task configuration is located in Datacap\ProgramSet. The application settings are in the application DCO folder. 

Customers must manually update the task setting in each application where they are installed.

Known limitations in IBM Datacap 9.0.1 Feature Pack 1 

Read this information to learn about known limitations in IBM Datacap 9.0.1 Feature Pack 1. 

 

 

Component Summary TMWeb Scan Windows 10 supported with IBM Datacap 9.0.1 FP1 with the following known limitations:

1. TMweb's "IE Test" page may result in a dialog box titled “Accusoft Twain Pro7 common 9.0.013” with the message "picdll Load Library failed.”
2. When trying to perform a Web scan with a Physical Scanner connected (via twain drivers) , ie using Web Vscan configured with scancl.aspx, the message "picdll Load Library failed" may be displayed. 

If any of these messages appear, TMWeb scanning will not be possible. Medical Claims When in MClaims Prof Red/Black FixupScan, clicking "Next LC" button will advance to the next page and display the data for it (Type and Status), but will keep the previous page selected as well, and changes to Status (from "Invalid Claim Type" to "New Claim") will not be saved.

Suggested workaround: 
After clicking "Next LC" button, which will show previous page and current page selected in the Batch View display, then click the current page node in the Batch View display to properly select only the current page. After this one can continue to change the page Status and click "Next LC" button and repeat workaround for the next page.

 IBM Configuring file content extraction tools for IBM Connections Search - United States stellent file content conversion extraction TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
IBM Connections uses the Stellent (Oracle Outside In Technology) Export utility to extract text from documents of various types. The extracted text is added to the Search index allowing users to find documents based on the content. 

When the Stellent utility is not configured correctly, file content will not be extracted or indexed. Therefore, search results within IBM Connections will not contain any matches on file content. For any content extraction issues, follow the steps in this tech note. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 1 Stellent installation 

Ensure that the following IBM Connections post-installation task has been carried out:
http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/lcwiki.nsf/dx/Copying_Search_conversion_tools_to_local_nodes_ic40 [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/lcwiki.nsf/dx/Copying_Search_conversion_tools_to_local_nodes_ic40]


 2 Running the exporter in isolation from IBM Connections 

To verify that the exporter is working correctly, you can run it on the command line in isolation from IBM Connections. To run the exporter executable on the command line, execute the following as the user that the Search WebSphere Application Server is running under: 

1. Change directory to the Stellent binary location. For example: 

 $ cd /opt/IBM/Connections/data/local/search/stellent/dcs/oiexport

2. Run the exporter command.
The exporter command has the following syntax: 

 exporter inputpath=<path_to_input_file>
outputpath=<path_to_extracted_text_output>
outputid=FI_SEARCHTEXT

For example,
$ ./exporter inputpath=/root/translation.pdf \ outputpath=/root/testStellent.txt outputid=FI_SEARCHTEXT

If the text extraction worked successfully, you will see the following output: 

Export complete

However, if you see a message like the one below, continue to step 3:

./exporter: error while loading shared libraries: libsc_ex.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory 


 3 Operating System Environment Variables 

Ensure that the operating system environment variables LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PATH are set correctly in Section 1. Both variables should contain the Stellent installation directory. To get the current values of the environment variables, run the following commands as the user that the Search WebSphere Application Server is running under:

$ echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
$ echo $PATH

To verify that the Stellent exporter executable can be found through the PATH environment variable, run the following command:

$ which exporter

The output of this command should contain the full path to the exporter executable. For example:

/opt/IBM/Connections/data/local/search/stellent/dcs/oiexport/exporter


 4 WebSphere Environment 

Using the WebSphere Application Server administration console, ensure that the WebSphere environment variable FILE_CONTENT_CONVERSION points to the exporter executable. 

For example: /opt/IBM/Connections/data/local/search/stellent/dcs/oiexport/exporter


 5 File Permissions 

Ensure that the user that the Search WebSphere Application Server is running under has sufficient privileges. They should have read/write/execute permissions on the exporter executable and read/write permissions on the other files in the Stellent installation directory.


 6 Library compatibility 

Verify that the libraries deployed with Stellent are compatible with your platform.

For example, on a 64 bit Linux system:
$ uname -a
Linux host1 2.6.18-308.11.1.el5 #1 SMP Fri Jun 15 15:41:53 EDT 2012 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

$ cd /opt/IBM/Connections/data/local/search/stellent/dcs/oiexport
$ file libsc_ex.so
libsc_ex.so: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, AMD x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), not stripped

(Note that your Stellent installation may contain 32 bit libraries though you are running on 64 bit platform. This is not an issue, provided that the 32 bit compatible libraries are on the LD_LIBRARY_PATH or can be found on the shared library search path).


 7 Shared library dependencies 

The Stellent exporter executable has a number of dependencies on both the shared libraries packaged with Stellent and on shared libraries installed on your system. To verify that all the required shared libraries can be found, use the 'ldd' command on the exporter executable as follows:

$ ldd -v exporter

Check the output of this command for any shared libraries marked as '=> not found'. 

 Stellent shared library not found 

If a Stellent shared library can't be found, then check that the setting of your LD_LIBRARY_PATH operating system environment variable contains the Stellent installation directory. 

 System shared library not found 

If a system shared library can't be found, then you are missing a prerequisite library.
NOTE: It is still possible to pick up libraries from locations other than those included in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH operating system environment variable, as long as they can be found elsewhere on the system's default search path. 

In addition to libc.so.6, Stellent is dependent upon the following libraries: 
libstdc++.so.5
libgcc_s.so.1 

For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.0 and later, it is possible that you are missing the package compat-libstdc++-33 . This package contains libstdc++.so.5.

Components in CICS TS

CICS TS provides the following embedded runtime components: 

 * Equinox
   Equinox is an implementation of the OSGi core framework specification and is provided for both OSGi JVM servers and for Liberty JVM servers. Service for these components is provided when and if required.
   
   
 * Apache Axis2™ 
   Axis2 is an open source web services engine from the Apache Software Foundation and is used within CICS to provide the web service Java™ engine for the Axis2 JVM server environment. Service for this component is provided when and if required.
   
   
 * WebSphere Application Server Liberty Profile
   Liberty fix packs are provided on a regular basis through the CICS TS APAR delivery process and provide an update mechanism to keep the embedded CICS Liberty runtime synchronized with the fix packs provided by WebSphere Application Server. Keeping current helps you resolve problems faster for 2 reasons:  * Liberty APAR fixes (known as ifixes) can only be delivered on the latest Liberty fix pack that has been supplied by the CICS APAR process. 
    * CICS APAR fixes can require other fixes such as WebSphere Liberty fix packs.
   
   
   

CICS Explorer and z/OS Explorer
The CICS Software Development Kit (SDK) for Java includes components from CICS for developing CICS Java applications. The CICS SDK for Servlet and JSP support includes Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) and Liberty API libraries, and automatically installs required components such as WebSphere Developer Toolkit (WDT)." Service for these components is provided through the CICS Explorer fix pack process when and if required.

Update recommendations

Recommended Service Upgrade (RSU) 
IBM recommends that you install all RSU [http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/z/os/zos/support/servicetest/] PTFs as preventive software maintenance for CICS TS. An RSU is a predefined collection of PTFs identified with a SOURCEID of RSUyymm, where yy indicates the last 2 digits of the year and mm indicates the month. [http://www-03.ibm.com/servers/eserver/zseries/zos/servicetst/]You can order an RSU [http://www-1.ibm.com/servers/eserver/zseries/zos/servicetst/]from ShopzSeries [https://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/ShopzSeries/ShopzSeries.jsp].


Equinox and Apache Axis2
There is unlikely to be much maintenance for Equinox and Axis2. Service for these components is provided when and if required, meaning it will be on a case by case basis and in most cases this will be to resolve service requests.


WebSphere Application Server Liberty Profile
Refer to Updating Liberty profile for CICS TS and z/OS Connect EE to latest version [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21993579] for a list of APARs you will need to update CICS TS and z/OS Connect Enterprise Edition (EE) to the latest version of WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile. 


CICS Explorer
IBM recommends that you upgrade to the latest release of CICS Explorer to obtain the most recent functionality and service. Old releases of CICS Explorer are not generally updated with new function, but new CICS Explorer releases are compatible with all earlier versions of CICS TS. Therefore, CICS Explorer V5.4 is compatible with CICS TS V4.1 through V5.4. For further details see Latest version of CICS Explorer and CICS Tools plug-ins for CICS Explorer [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21404312].

 IBM How to determine if a TIP server is part of a HA cluster - United States TIPL2; TIPL2CONF; TIPL2HALB; Load balancing; high availability; Tivoli Integrated Portal; HA; TIP; HATool; modules; database TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What steps can be used to determine if a Tivoli Integrated Portal server is part of a High Availability server group? 

ANSWER
Use the HATool.{bat|sh} command located in the <TIP HOME>/profiles/TIPProfile/bin/ha directory. The usage for that command is:
HATool.{bat|sh} modules <db2 username> <db2 password>

If this returns a list of modules, then HA is configured and the server is joined.
If this returns empty, then HA is configured, but server is disjoined.
If this throws Database Connection errors, then HA has never been configured on this server.

See the following technical note for complete details on High Availability/load balancing configuration:

 IBM Correct understanding of CSV version of PVU reports - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What files are in the audit snapshot generated by IBM License Metric Tool or IBM BigFix Inventory version 9.x, and what is the correct interpretation of the values in the CSV report files? 

CAUSE
The licensing reports in CSV format can be misinterpreted by some customers.

ANSWER
Audit snapshot is a record of PVU and RVU MAPC utilization in your enterprise over a period of time. It contains the following files: 

 * audit_trail.csv – all user actions that influence the final results of the licensing reports, for example, software classification actions, uploads and imports of the PVU table, software catalog, and charge units as well as changes to the VM managers. 
 * data_conditions.txt – conditions that were used during the generation of the audit snapshot, including the reporting period and filters applied on the reports as well as general information about the time when the snapshot was generated, version of the PVU table and software catalog, status of the import, aggregation, and recalculation. 
 * part_numbers.csv - part numbers that are listed in the software catalog for all software products that are included in any of the CSV report files. 
 * pvu_full_capacity.csv - PVU full capacity license metric results 
 * pvu_sub_capacity.csv - PVU subcapacity license metric results 
 * rvu_full_capacity.csv - RVU full capacity license metric results 
 * rvu_sub_capacity.csv - RVU subcapacity license metric results 
 * bundling_definitions.csv - list of IBM software regardless of its license type and utilization together with details of the computers on which the software is installed 
 * readme.txt - a link to this document (technote) 
 * checksums.txt, signature.rsa, and pub_key.pem - files used by IBM auditors to verify the authenticity and correctness of the audit snapshot.



Why some product instances are not listed in the CSV reports? 

CSV reports with information about PVU and RVU MAPC utilization (pvu_full_capacity.csv, pvu_sub_capacity.csv, rvu_full_capacity.csv, and rvu_sub_capacity.csv) list only software instances that were discovered during the license peak value time. If an instance was installed in your environment during the reporting period of the current audit snapshot but was not discovered during the license peak value time, the instance is not listed in the CSV reports. 

Example: 
Three instances of DB2 are installed. The reporting period is set to one month and DB2 license utilization is as follows: 
· Instance 1 uses the maximum of 100 PVUs, 
· Instance 2 uses the maximum of 300 PVUs, 
· Instance 3 uses the maximum of 500 PVUs. 

The license peak value occurs when the sum of PVU values for all instances is the highest and equals 800 PVUs (300 PVUs for instance 2 + 500 PVUs for instance 3). The peak occurs during the period that is marked with a red square (it is the license peak value time). The peak usage for instance 1 is outside of the red square. It means that this instance was installed in the environment during the current reporting period but was not discovered during the license peak value time. This instance is not listed in the CSV report. 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688543&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688543&aid=1]  


Why some values from the CSV report do not relate back to what is displayed on the user interface? 

When all values from column M (Physical Server PVU Subcapacity) for a particular product are added, the obtained value is greater that the value that is displayed in the user interface. It happens due to the way that data is presented in CSV reports and on the user interface. 

The All IBM Metrics and IBM PVU subcapacity reports are multilevel, and consist of the following levels:
1. First level: a list of all products
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688543&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688543&aid=2] 


2. Second level: when you click a product name, you go to information about the physical server on which the product is installed.
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688543&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688543&aid=3] 

 

3. Third level: when you click the server name, you go to a list of virtual machines that run on this server and have the product installed. 
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688543&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688543&aid=4] 


The audit snapshot is not multilevel. However, it has to present the same information that the report that is available in the user interface. Below is an excerpt from the audit snapshot that corresponds to the report that was presented on the screen shots above (some columns are hidden in the snapshot to simplify it).

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688543&aid=5] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688543&aid=5] 

 

When values in column M are added, PVU consumption equals 480 PVUs. However, these values should not be added because they all refer to a single server (TLM_VM_423…) on which the four VMs run, not an individual VM that is listed in column P (Computer). 

The value in column M is repeated due to the way data needs to be presented in a CSV file. If you want to relate back the value from column M in the audit snapshot to the user interface report, it is the value that you can see in the column PVU Subcapacity Limit on the second level of the report. The value in column L relates back to the column CPU Core Subcapacity on the second level of the report. 

 
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688543&aid=6] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688543&aid=6] 


PVU and RVU MAPC subcapacity license terms specify license consumption only on the physical server level. PVU and RVU MAPC values cannot be calculated and presented on the virtual machine or LPAR level, and such data is not provided by License Metric Tool or BigFix Inventory. For more information about virtualization capacity license counting rules that are used for PVU and RVU MAPC calculation, see:

 IBM Java SDK Upgrade Policy for the IBM WebSphere Application Server - United States upgrade policy TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What is the Java™ SDK upgrade policy for the IBM® WebSphere® Application Server? 

CAUSE
Updating to the latest compatible Java SDK could help you resolve problems more quickly.

ANSWER
The IBM WebSphere Application Server Java SDK can be upgraded to the latest service release for the same Java SDK version. 

List of WebSphere Application Server fix packs and the corresponding Java SDK versions [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg27005002]

Policy Summary by WebSphere Application Server release:

WebSphere Application Server V8.0, V8.5, V8.5.5
Starting with V8.0 and applicable to all subsequent releases and fixpacks, there is one install package that contains updates for both WebSphere Application Server and Java SDK. Applying fixpacks of WebSphere Application Server also upgrades the SDK that is packaged and bundled within the fixpack. Additionally, separate Java SDK fixpacks are also available that contain just the SDK updates which can be applied to upgrade the SDK.

WebSphere Application Server V7.0
Any V7.0 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.6.0 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.

WebSphere Application Server V6.1
Any V6.1 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.5.0 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.

WebSphere Application Server V6.0
Any V6.0 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.4.2 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.

WebSphere Application Server V5.1
Any V5.1 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.4.1 and any V5.1.1 can be upgraded to the latest Java SDK 1.4.2 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.

WebSphere Application Server V5.0
Any V5.0 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.3.1 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.



Details of Java SDK Upgrade Policy

WebSphere Application Server leverages the Java SDK as a base component. This results in unique support issues, including:


 * Matching Java SDK service releases to Application Server releases and fix packs
   
   
 * Delivering updates and fixes associated with the Java SDK on any given Application Server release.


In an effort to resolve customer Java SDK situations as quickly as possible, WebSphere Application Server Support has done a quickest-path-to-resolution analysis, determining the most direct way to collect problem information. 

In some cases, problem resolution might include finding shortcuts to resolve symptoms. One shortcut is an immediate upgrade to a newer compatible Java SDK service release, before gathering detailed problem determination data. 

There are multiple advantages to performing an immediate Java SDK upgrade as a quicker path to resolution over a full Problem Determination (PD) process: 
 1. There is a continuous stream of fixes going into the Java SDK. Many problems encountered by customers are resolved by these fixes.
    
    
 2. When a new problem is encountered, applying the latest Java SDK is a quick way to determine if related fixes change the symptoms or correct the problem.
    
    
 3. Many documented Java SDK fixes have common symptoms. Frequently, limited PD data does not isolate the problem to a single root cause.
    


These factors highlight the advantage of applying a newer Java SDK before working through a full PD cycle. 

Java SDK and WebSphere Application Server software are updated frequently. To avoid compatibility issues for customers, WebSphere Application Server Support maintains this Java SDK Upgrade Policy. 

WebSphere Application Server Support details: 
http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/support.html [http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/support.html] 

Identifying compatibility limitations between WebSphere Application Server releases and Java SDK service releases that have not been tested together reduces risk. 

Important: Using a Java SDK not specifically packaged with WebSphere Application Server and supplied by IBM, or in violation of the Java SDK Upgrade Policy, is not supported by IBM WebSphere Application Server Support for Java SDK problems. RELATED INFORMATION

 IBM How do I process Sparse data objects Identified in the Audit - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I turn on sparse data object processing 

ANSWER
After harvesting a volume, the audit may show "skipped - cannot 
access data object", with a sparse data object message recorded in the details section. 

To correct this problem, ensure that no jobs are running. SSH into the Data Server(s) and enter the following command at the prompt; 


psql -U dfuser dfdata -c "insert into adminknobs (name,value,description,valuetype,use) VALUES ('read_sparse_files','1','Read sprase data objects','int','1')"

It should return the following;

INSERT 0 1

if so, enter the following command and wait for the UI to come back up;

service siqinit restart

You can now run harvests as normal and sparse data objects will be processed. If your are using a policy which backs up the original files and just leaves a sparse file viewable that when accessed, will pull the original file forward, you may run into space issues. This is because SIQ will be accessing every sparse file, so the sparse files' size on disk will grow to the same size as the original file.

 IBM Error # 2070. The license server is down. Specific symptom number: 3 - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 We have network installations of IBM SPSS Statistics/Modeler. When the application is launched, the following errors are reported:

"The current license does not permit this job to continue."

followed by...

"Error # 2070
The license server is down. Please check to see that the license server is running or ask your local SPSS coordinator to check the license server.
This command is not executed.
Specific symptom number: 3."

The Safenet Sentinel License Manager has been licensed and confirmed to be running. 
What is the problem? 

CAUSE
The above error can be caused by invalid values entered during the licensing phase of installing SPSS Statistics/Modeler or the client machine cannot reach the Sentinel License Manager host using the machine Hostname.

ANSWER
Please do the following to verify:

1. Navigate to the IBM SPSS Statistics/Modeler directory and open "spssprod.inf", using any text editor. 

 - By default, SPSS Statistics would store this file in: C:\Program Files\IBM\SPSS\Statistics\xx\ 

 - By default, SPSS Modeler would store this file in: C:\Program Files\IBM\SPSS\Modeler\xx.x\bin\

2. Verify the "DaemonHost" value matches the Hostname or IP Address of the machine where the Safenet Sentinel License Manager is installed. 

 - E.g. DaemonHost=MyLicenseServer or DaemonHost=127.0.0.1

If the DaemonHost value specifies redundant license servers, please do the following if you are using SPSS Statistics 22 (or earlier) or SPSS Modeler 16.0 (or earlier):


 a). Remove all license servers from the "DaemonHost" line and save the file.

b). Create a system environment variable, called LSHOST, on each SPSS client with your redundant license servers as its value. Separate each redundant license server with a colon, e.g.
==========================
Variable: LSHOST
Value: server1:server2:server3
========================== 



If the "DaemonHost" value is accurate and you are using a Hostname value, you have a name resolution problem. Error # 2070, Symptom number 3 typically means the SPSS client cannot connect to the name resolution database or the name resolution database does not contain a record for the machine where the SPSS Sentinel License Manager resides. To verify, please do the following:

1. Run lswhere.exe (which is located in the SPSS directory, see above) from the problematic SPSS Client machine and take note of the displayed output. The following is an example of the output: 


==========================
Sentinel LM 8.x.x Search Tool For License Servers
Copyright (C) 20xx Rainbow Technologies, Inc.

Server Address : xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
Server Name : Machine_A
========================== 


If the Safenet Sentinel License Manager machine is not listed or you encounter the error, "Error[17]: Probably no servers are running on this subnet.", please add the following system environment variable to the IBM SPSS Statistics/Modeler client and run lswhere.exe again: 


==========================
Variable: LSHOST
Value: Name or IP address of the License Manager machine 
========================== 


For information about defining environment variables, see the Network License Administrator's Guide. If using the LSHOST environment variable does not render the Safenet Sentinel License Manager machine, try using LSFORCEHOST instead.

2. When you see the Safenet Sentinel License Manager machine name and corresponding IP address listed in the lswhere output, ping the displayed Server Name from a command line, e.g.


==========================
ping Machine_A
========================== 


An example of the resulting output is as follows:
==========================
Unknown host Machine_A
========================== 


If the ping command is unable to resolve the Server Name, you have a name resolution problem and must address it (with help from your IT Administrator/Help Desk team) before IBM SPSS Statistics/Modeler can acquire a license from the Sentinel License Manager.

 IBM Product upgrade installed a second instance of the DE, causing upgrade failure. - United States DEL2INST; Tivoli; Deployment; Engine; FQDN; Duplicate; acsi TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The Deployment Engine should only have one instance installed on a server with IBM products installed. In this case, a second DE was installed, which caused the failure of the Product upgrade.
Error: Wrong Deployment Engine. 

SYMPTOM
Product install failed. You will get a message similar to this:
You are updating an instance of <Product name> that was installed using 
the Tivoli Deployment Engine (DE) located at "/home/nc_admin/.acsi_<Fully Qualified hostname>". 
However you are now using the DE located at "/home/nc_admin/.acsi_<hostname>". 


When the DE is installed as non-root ( in this case nc_admin ), it will install the DE in the user home directory, in this case /home/nc_admin, and use the FQDN in the name: /home/nc_admin/.acsi_<Fully Qualified hostname> 


CAUSE
Because the two Product installs used different versions of JVM, the underlying Java is using "hostname" for one version of JVM, and "Fully Qualified hostname" for the other. The DE normally uses the FQDN appended to the "acsi_" string to create the DE directory:

For example, if the Product is being installed as user "nc_admin" and the entry in /etc/hosts is this:

x.xx.xxx.xx server_name.corporation.net server_name

The hostname is "server_name"
Fully Qualified hostname (FQDN) is "server_name.corporation.net"


ENVIRONMENT
Upgrading existing product that uses the Deployment Engine on a UNIX server



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Output similar to this when the Product install fails: 

the Tivoli Deployment Engine (DE) located at "/home/nc_admin/.acsi_<Fully qualified hostname>". 
However you are now using the DE located at "<User_home>/nc_admin/.acsi_<hostname>"


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There are two options to fix this problem. 

1) Make sure the current upgrade is using the same version of JVM as the original install. 

2) Removing the newly created DE, which shouldn't have been created, then creating a link to the existing DE is the best work around in this case. The Product upgrade will see the link and add the information to the valid DE install. 

*IMPORTANT NOTE: The Product install failure message will tell you what instance of the DE is valid, please refer to the error message in the "Symptom" section above. 

 At this point there will be the following in the DE_HOME directory: 

 .acsi_<FQDN> ( Valid DE installation ) 

 .acsi_<userid> ( link to .acsi_<FQDN> ) 

 .acsi_<hostname> ( Invalid DE directory created by the failed Product upgrade ) 

 This can be confirmed by referring to the Product install error. 

 Removing the invalid DE and creating softlink: 

 - Backup the original DE installation directory: <DE_HOME>/.acsi_<FQDN> 

 - Move the new invalid DE directory to a backup directory: <DE_HOME>/.acsi_<hostname> 

 - Create a soft link to the "good" DE install 

 cd <DE_HOME> 

 ln -s <DE_HOME>/.acsi_<FQDN> .acsi_<hostname> 

 - Confirm the link was created successfully, it should look like this: 
> ls -lart 
lrwxrwxrwx 1 nc_admin ncoadmin <date> .acsi_<hostname> -> <DE_HOME>/.acsi_<FQDN> 

 
3) Retry the product install. You will need to confirm there is no required cleanup before retrying the Product upgrade. 

 IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance MQ Manager Object's connections are not closed as expected. - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA appliance MQ Manager Object's connections are not closed as expected. This can happen when the mq-qm object uses the default value which is an empty string. 

CAUSE
DataPower MQ manager object's idle connection is not closed when using default cache timeout.

ANSWER
Change the cache timeout on the IBM WebSphere DataPower MQ manager (mq-qm) object. You can start using a value of 60 seconds as the suggestion. The best practice is to use a value which should be less than the KeepAlive Timeout of the MQ Queue Manager (qmgr).

 IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in SSLv3 affects IBM HTTP Server (CVE-2014-3566) - United States  SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 SSLv3 contains a vulnerability that has been referred to as the Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption (POODLE) attack. SSLv3 is enabled by default in the Apache based IBM HTTP Server. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE ID: CVE-2014-3566 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3566]
DESCRIPTION: IBM HTTP Server could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a design error when using the SSLv3 protocol. A remote user with the ability to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability via a POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) attack to decrypt SSL sessions and access the plain text of encrypted connections. 

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97013 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97013] for the current score

CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N) 

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
This vulnerability affects all versions and releases of IBM HTTP Server (IHS) component in all editions of WebSphere Application Server and bundling products.


REMEDIATION/FIXES
There is no separate interim fix for the PI27904 APAR that is associated with this issue, but the interim fix for APAR PI31516 (TLS Padding Vulnerability CVE-2014-8730 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21692502]) includes the update for APAR PI27904. APAR PI27904 update disables SSLv3 by default for IHS 7.0 and newer, and adds the 'SSLProtocolEnable' directive into IHS 7.0. 

The update for PI27904 will be included in fix packs 7.0.0.37, 8.0.0.10 and 8.5.5.4. 


WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
For all releases and versions of Apache based IBM HTTP Server, IBM recommends disabling SSLv3: 


Add the following directive to the httpd.conf file to disable SSLv3 and SSLv2 for each context that contains "SSLEnable":

# Disable SSLv3 for CVE-2014-3566
# SSLv2 is disabled in V8R0 and later by default, and in typical V7
# and earlier configurations disabled implicitly when SSLv3 ciphers 
# are configured with SSLCipherSpec.
SSLProtocolDisable SSLv3 SSLv2

Stop and restart IHS for the changes to take affect.

Note: 

 * If you start IHS with the -f command line argument, or you use the "Include" directive to include alternate configuration files, you may need to search those filenames for SSLEnable.

 * If you configure SSL with SSLEnable in the global (non-virtualhost) scope, you will need to move SSLEnable into a virtualhost scope to add SSLProtocolDisable


IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas that enable SSLv3 protocol and take appropriate mitigation (such as disabling SSLv3) and remediation actions. GET NOTIFIED ABOUT FUTURE SECURITY BULLETINS

 IBM Unable to connect using network services: WebGUI or ssh after upgrading WebSphere DataPower firmware - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why can't I access the Web managment or ssh after upgrading firmware? 

CAUSE
This can occur if you are using a custom certificate or authentication for the management services and any of the associated certificates are expired. Expired certificates are removed at upgrade time.

ANSWER
The first step is to verify that the network is functioning correctly using these commands: 

show int 

show int mode 

show route 

 

Those commands will show if there is any network activity as well as the ethernet link speed. 

Once the network is confirmed, the quickest way to recover the web management and ssh services is to delete and recreate them with the default settings using the serial console. 

The following commands will reset the RBM's, ACL's, WebGUI and SSH services to the default settings. 

Note: If the ssh is working, you may omit any commands with the ssh. 

 

config 

web-mgmt 

no ssl 

exit 

write mem 

y 

no web-mgmt 

no ssh 

rbm 

reset 

exit 

acl web-mgmt 

reset 

exit 

acl ssh 

reset 

exit 

write mem (key step to remove the current settings) 

y 

web-mgmt <ip to listen on or 0.0.0.0 for all> <port to use default is9090> 

ssh <ip to listen on or 0.0.0.0 for all> <port to use default is22> 

write mem 

y 

 

Once complete, test the service and confirm you can now access the appliance. Then you may work to configure any custom certificates or authentication settings desired.

 IBM BigFix Server unable to gather site content from sync.bigfix.com (error: Unexpected HTTP response: 404) - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Identifying a block between the BigFix Server and IBM BigFix's sync.bigfix.com content servers. 

SYMPTOM
Error messages similar to the following in the BESRelay.log on the BigFix server: 

 * 
 * 
 * http://sync.bigfix.com/cgi-bin/bfgather/bessupport?Time=1452540085:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Error messages similar to the following in the GatherDB.log on the BigFix server:
   Mon, 11 Jan 2016 14:43:22 -0500 -- Unexpected exception during gather of site BES Support: Unexpected HTTP response: 404


Note: If the BES Support cannot gather for the first time the entire console is empty of its UI elements. 
CAUSE
 

 1. There is most likely an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) between the BigFix server and our content sites at sync.bigfix.com that is dropping the download because it is detecting something in the download (one of the sites files) as being malicious. If you do not have an IPS between the BigFix server and the sync.bigfix.com servers; it may be the firewall or proxy appliance that is causing the issue. 
 2. Another cause might be that Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration is enabled for Administrators on the BigFix Windows server machine.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

 1. Check with the firewall/proxy/IPS/network admin and ask them to check the logs for dropped packets or downloads and to adjust the rules to allow the BES Support site content through. 
 2. Try turning off Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration [https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/chenley/2011/03/10/how-to-turn-off-internet-explorer-enhanced-security-configuration/] for Administrators to see if this resolves the issue.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  All users of IBM WebSphere Application      *
   *                  Server                                      *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Virtual member manager (VMM) throws     *
   *                      InvalidUniqueNameException when the     *
   *                      login attribute value contains an       *
   *                      equal sign "=".                         *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   VMM throws InvalidUniqueNameException when the login attribute
   value contains a "=". When an equal sign "=" is encountered in
   the login name for example 'tw=admin', VMM treats this as a
   distinguished name (DN) and hence the login fails.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  You need to set a custom property using the following
   command
   
   $AdminTask configureAdminWIMUserRegistry {-customProperties
   {"com.ibm.ws.wim.registry.allowDNPrincipalNameAsLiteral
   =true"} }
   
   When this property is set, VMM determines whether the login
   name ends with a baseEntry. If the login name does not end
   with a baseEntry it is not treated as a DN and the login is
   successful.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   fix packs 8.0.0.4 and 8.5.0.1.  Please refer to the

 IBM Command Line configuration for J2EE Data Collector - United States ITCAM; J2EE; CLI; configurator; CAMJ2ALL; CAMJ2INST TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Command Line configuration for J2EE DC is not working as expected when trying to enable MS or TT features. 

CAUSE
Interactive CLI configuration is not supported with ITCAM J2EE 7.1.1, including last available level 7.1.1.0.4.

ANSWER
Supported methods are GUI and silent configuration. 

Also, silent configuration fully works both on UNIX and Windows platforms only at level 7.1.1.0.4.
Before this maintenance level there were issues and limitations with Managing Server and Transaction Tracking integration. 

 

Support Command Line configuration for J2EE DC will possibly be added in some future patch via Request For Enhancement.

 IBM EIF probe not receiving itm events - United States om_tec.conf eif probe itm event clearing omnibus TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 ITM is sending events to EIF probe which is then forwarded to the OMNIbus Server. Client is observing that the clearing event is sent per the ITM trace/log but the event does not seem to be received into EIF or OMNIbus as the triggered event is still seen in OMNIbus.



SYMPTOM
Situation in ITM is no longer true but event is not cleared in OMNIbus.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The iptrace shows that the EIF probe on the OMNIbus side is resetting/closing(<RST>) the TCP/IP connection after it receives the event and it never shows up in the EIF logs, so the event is just dropped.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The solution is to set the connection_mode in your om_tec.config on the ITM Server (TEMS) to use 


connection_less 

instead of 

connection oriented.

That is, change this line in your om_tec.config

ConnectionMode=co
to
ConnectionMode=connection_less

You will need to restart the EIF on your ITM. (tacmd refreshTECinfo -t eif)

 IBM Limitations when deploying more than one Rule Execution Server console - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 It is possible to deploy several Rule Execution Server (RES) Console in the same cluster, however there are some administrative interactions from RES components to RES console that may not work due to the presence of more than one RES management stack within the same administrative scope. 

SYMPTOM
When a RES component makes an attempt to interact with a RES Console management stack (through a JMX invocation) the following exception may occur if more than one RES Console is deployed within an administrative cell: 

...
java.lang.IllegalStateException 
at ilog.rules.res.mbean.util.IlrSingleMBeanInvocationHandler.invoke(Unknown Source)
...

Note: a similar exception can be seen when no RES Console is found so the first thing to verify is that a RES Console is completely deployed and that it passes the diagnostic properly before considering the issue in this present note.


CAUSE
The scope of the management API (JMX) is typically that of the Cell (WebSphere), Domain (Weblogic) or Partition(JBoss). RES components that interact directly with the RES Console management stack normally expect to find exactly one RES Console within the this management scope : an error can arise from not finding a RES Console management stack, as well as finding more than one.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Certain use cases are supported that involve deploying more than one RES console in a cluster, most notably for situations where a active/passive fail over is needed, see the following document for more information: Clustering Rule Execution Server (RES) management console [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21426014] 


However there is a number of limitations that one can face when several RES consoles are deployed within the same administrative cell, such as : 

 1. The use of the API ilog.rules.session.IlrManagementSession (reference [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc/html/api/html/ilog/rules/res/session/IlrManagementSession.html]) may fail with a java.lang.IllegalStateException as per the symptom above. In this situation, the only option is to deploy a single RES Console per cell. 
 2. With JRules 6.x deploying RSM in a cell where more than one RES console is deployed can lead to java.lang.IllegalStateException as per the symptom above when attempting to add an SSP through the RSM console. 
 3. With JRules 7.x DVS scenario suite executions initiated from Rule Studio to be run on a remote Java EE server in a cell where more than one RES console is deployed may fail with java.lang.IllegalStateException as per the symptom above. 
 4. The use of interceptors (i.e. IlrSessionInterceptor implementations) may fail with a java.lang.IllegalStateException or an error message such as ilog.rules.res.session.interceptor.IlrSessionInterceptorException: Unable to find RuleApp /myruleapp/myruleset for use by the interceptor. In this situation, the only option is to deploy a single RES Console per cell.


For situations 2. and 3. note that DVS and RSM are normally deployed in a non-production environment since they support the testing process of the rules prior to their deployment to production. So in practice it is not necessary to deploy multiple RES console instances for fail over purpose when in a testing environment. The recommendation is then to set up RES console and SSP in a testing cell that is separate from the production cell. In this testing cell, only one instance of RES console should be installed.

 IBM How do I change the default 'fit content by' behaviour of Daeja viewer in IBM Content Navigator, to fit content by height or width? - United States fit by height; fit by width; fit; default fit; Daeja viewer; FileNet viewer; Daeja; scale TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I change the default 'fit content by' behaviour of Daeja viewer in IBM Content Navigator, to fit content by height or width? 

ANSWER
In Content Navigator v2.0.2 

In the ..navigator.war/applets/filenetViewer_properties.jsp file, set the value of the parameter 'scale' as follows 

To fit content by width, specify - scale: "ftow",
To fit content by height, specify - scale: "ftoh",

Here's another way to modify the behaviour: 

 * make the same changes above to the filenetViewer_properties.jsp under ECMClient\configure\explodedformat\navigator\applets folder. 
 * Rebuild and redeploy the ear file. 
 * Restart the application server


Save the changes and they should get picked up when the viewer is re-launched.  

In Content Navigator v2.0.3 

The same parameter-value pair mentioned above can be added in the Additional Settings section of the Daeja ViewONE panel, of the admin desktop. Add the parameter-value pair to the Additional Settings section of 

 * the Professional tab for modifying the behaviour of the Daeja Professional viewer 
 * the Virtual tab for modifying the behaviour of the Daeja Virtual viewer.


Click New in the Additional Settings section to add the parameter-value pair. Save the changes and they should get picked up when the viewer is re-launched.

 IBM Security Cache, LTPA Token, and Session Time Outs - United States session; cache; logout; login; timeout; time out; LTPA TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What happens when the Security Cache, LTPA Token timeout, and session time out? 

ANSWER
Question 1 
What happens when the Security Cache times out? Will the user be asked to re-login?

Answer 1 
No. When using single sign-on (SSO), the Security Cache will refresh from the LTPA Token. If your LTPA Token is also expired, then the user will be asked to re-login. Also, the cache timeout period is reset every time that entry is hit. So, if the entry is hit 9 minutes into the 10 minute timeout period, the clock is reset at that time. So, instead of timing out in another minute, it is now reset for another 10 minutes, then if it's hit again in that time, it will get extended again. 

When using Local operating system for authentication, the user will be asked to login when the session times out, not the security cache. 

In V6.1, the Federated Repository has it's own cache settings. See the link under Related Information. 

Question 2 

 1. Using a browser, we accessed a secured application, we provided the UserID (UserA) and a valid PW (Password1). A token was created. So far everything is working fine. 
    
 2. You manually changed the password for UserA in the LTPA (LDAP or custom registry) from Password1 to Password2. 
 3. Using a new browser we accessed the application providing UserA and the new password (Password2) a token was created and again everything is working as expected. 
    
 4. Using a another new browser we accessed the application providing UserA and the old password (Password1). You were surprised to notice that a token was created and UserA was able to access the application. 


Answer 2 
The old password takes up to 1.5 times the security cache to disappear. It will also expire at the end of the LTPA token timeout. 

In IBM WebSphere Application Server V5.0.2 and later, you can purge a user from the security cache using an MBean interface. See the Related Information at the end of this article. 


Question 3 
I want to force my users to re-login after a set "inactivity timeout" period. How is WebSphere Application Server supposed to work with regard to session timeouts and LTPA timeout. Answer 3 
See the answer to this question in item 9 of the following developerWorks article:
http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/techjournal/1003_botzum/1003_botzum.html [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/techjournal/1003_botzum/1003_botzum.html]


Question 4 
If this is the case, can we expire or delete the LTPAToken cookie when the session expires? If so, what mechanism should we use? 

Answer 4
You can manually perform a form-based logout (as described in the Information Center) to request that the LTPAToken cookie be destroyed in the web browser, but within WebSphere Application Server, there is no functionality to automatically perform the form-based logout when the session times out. This would have to be performed programmatically.

 IBM Format of XML-type ruleset parameters in SOAP messages with MTDS - United States XSD; schema; SOAP; web service TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How to format the value of an XML-type ruleset parameter in the SOAP request to a Monitored Transparent Decision Service (MTDS) ? 

CAUSE
As mentioned in the documentation for MTDS, XML parameters are represented by a String in the WSDL file.

ANSWER
The value of the parameter is the XML data corresponding to your input parameter XSD, either passed in a CDATA section or by escaping the XML special characters (replacing <, >, ", ' and & with &lt;, &gt;, &quot;, &apos; and &amp;). 

For more information on transparent decision services, refer to section "Rule Execution Server > Introducing Rule Execution Server > Rule Execution Server basics > Transparent decision services and rule execution" of the JRules V7.1 documentation [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc/Content/Business_Rules/Documentation/_pubskel/JRules/ps_JRules_Global926.html].

 IBM Exported dates to IBM FileNet Content Engine are one day off in IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture - United States FileNet P8; FNP8; Export; yesterday; GMT; UTC TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Dates exported to IBM FileNet P8 Content Engine show yesterday's date when viewed by an IBM FileNet Content Engine client 

CAUSE
IBM FileNet Content Engine stores all time stamps using UTC format. If a date is passed into IBM FileNet Content Engine with no time component then the time defaults to midnight UTC, which may indicate the prior date when converted back into local time.
Taskmaster does not convert or handle dates in GMT/UTC and thus any date values must be formatted by the application rules prior to export to IBM FileNet Content Engine


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Modify the date/time value into proper GMT/UTC format of YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM[:SS] and then add a time offset to account for the GMT time difference, e.g. YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS-HH:MM, prior to export to FileNet P8. 


The action IsFieldDateWithReformat from the Validations library can be called with a parameter of "s" (no quotation marks) to format a local date/time value to UTC; a GMT offset can be appended to a UTC value with any standard action such as rrSet from the rrunner library.

Example 1: 

Description Field Value (Case A) Field Value (Case B) Data captured 05/31/2012 15:00 05/31/2012 IsFieldDateWithReformat(s) 2012-05-31T15:00:00 2012-05-31T00:00:00 rrSet(@F+-07:00,@F) 2012-05-31T15:00:00-07:00 2012-03-15T00:00:00-07:00 Here the initial field value is first transformed to UTC. The rrSet action is called to append the GMT offset "-07:00" to the field value. 

Example 2: Description Field Value (Case A) Field Value (Case B) Data captured 05/31/2012 15:00 05/31/2012 IsFieldDateWithReformat(s) 2012-05-31T15:00:00 2012-05-31T00:00:00 rrSet(@F+@CHR(43)+07:00,@F) 2012-05-31T15:00:00+07:00 2012-03-15T00:00:00+07:00 Here the initial field value is first transformed to UTC. The rrSet action is called to append the GMT offset "+07:00" to the field value, @CHR is used to avoid conflict with the concatenation operator. 

Note: IBM FileNet Content Engine may have a back end setting for Daylight Savings Time (DST), thus modifying the GMT offset to account for DST may not be necessary.

4-9-2015 10:15:22 SEVERE: ERROR - Install aborted.


CAUSE
A limitation for remote deployment and silent installations indicates:
A silent installation terminates if product files are locked. This behavior ensures that the installer does not overwrite product files that are currently running. The best practice is to shut down all components, including monitoring servers, portal server, and portal clients before you perform any product upgrade. This limitation only affects silent installations. Installations through the installation wizard is not affected.


ENVIRONMENT
Any Windows version 

Any ITM component installed silently


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Look in <ITMHOME>\InstallITM for a file name with syntax similar to: 
AbortIBMTivoliMonitoring<DATE TIME>.log

For example:
AbortIBMTivoliMonitoring20150409 1014.log



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Workaround: Use the following method to resolve the problem:
1. Search the installation log for instances of the CheckLockedFiles string. Locked files are listed at these places. Locked files are files that might need to be upgraded during an installation, and because they are in use (locked) the silent install terminates.


2. Identify the process that is locking the files.


3. Stop the process.


4. Prevent file locking by modifying the response file for installation file. This step is required when a silent installation has terminated. 

a. Open the response file in a text editor. In many cases, the file in which you make this modification is named silent.txt. On Windows, the file to modify is the NT_Silent_Install.txt file that is located on the monitoring server.
b. Add the following line to the [INSTALLATION SECTION] area of your silent install response file:
Locked Files=continue
If you apply any other value or assign no value for this parameter, silent installations fail when locked files exist.
c. If Locked Files=continue is used in a silent install or remote deploy, the computer MUST be rebooted before ITM is brought up or another install is run. This is mandatory or the <ITMHOME> directory could become corrupt. If the <ITMHOME> directory becomes corrupt, all of ITM will have to be uninstalled and reinstalled.


5. Run the silent installation again.

    1.  From the Administrative Console, select Servers > Application Servers > server_name > Change Log Details Levels.
        
        
    2.  Remove any previous entries in the text field type the following:
        
        *=info:ORBRas=all
        
        
    3.  Apply and save changes.
        
        
    4.  Select Servers > Application Servers > server_name > Diagnostic Trace Service.
        
        
    5.  Change the Maximum Number of Historical Files to 10 and maximum file size to 50mb
        
        
    6.  Apply and save changes.
        
        
    7.  Enabling Comm Trace:
        
        Application Server
        From the Administrative Console, Select Servers > Application Servers > server_name > Container Services > ORB Service. Select the Orb Tracing check box to enable Comm Tracing.
        
        Node Agent
        From the Administrative Console, select System Administration >Node Agent > nodeagent > ORB Service. Select the Orb Tracing check box to enable Comm Tracing.
        
        Deployment Manager
        From the Administrative Console, Select System Administration > Deployment Manager > ORB Service. Select the Orb Tracing check box to enable Comm Tracing.
        
        NOTE: You will need to do a server restart for the Comm Tracing to be captured in the trace.log file. You can also leave the Orb Tracing check box checked permanently in case you run into another ORB issue in the future. That way, you don't have to do another server restart for the trace to be captured. Leaving the Orb Tracing check box checked won't log any data to a trace log unless you have the ORBRas=all trace string enabled (Step 2 above). This means it won't cause any performance issues or affect anything else in the server. 
    8.  Apply and save changes.
        
        
    9.  Restart the sever and recreate the problem
        
        
    10. Collect the following data:
        
        profile_root/logs/server_name/trace.log
   
    * 
    * profile_root
    * /logs/ffdc folder
   
    * 
      
    * NOTE: 
    * 
    * date
    * 
    * time
    * 
    * 
   
   
 * Stand Alone Java Client ORB Trace Instructions  1. Start the client program with the "-D" arguments to specify the trace settings
       
       -Dcom.ibm.CORBA.Debug=true -Dcom.ibm.CORBA.CommTrace=true -Dcom.ibm.CORBA.Debug.Output=client.log
       
       
    2. The ORB trace output is captured in the path pointed by com.ibm.CORBA.Debug.Output.
       
       If the com.ibm.CORBA.Debug.Output parameter is not specified, the ORB trace output is captured in a unique trace file named orbtrc.<timestamp>.txt in the current directory of execution.
       
       
    3. Collect the following file:
       
       orbtrc.<timestamp>.txt 
       
       
       
   
   
 * J2EE Client Trace Instructions  1. Start the launchClient script with the following arguments to enable the trace:
       
       install_root/bin/launchClient.sh <ear_file> -JVMOptions="-Dcom.ibm.CORBA.Debug=true -Dcom.ibm.CORBA.CommTrace=true" -CCtrace=ORBRas=all -CCtracefile=orbtrace.txt -CCtraceMode=basic
       
       
       Note: For Windows installations, use launchClient.bat instead of launchClient.sh
       
    2. The ORB trace output is captured in a unique trace file named orbtrace.txt in the current directory of execution.
       
       
    3. Collect the following file:
       
       orbtrace.txt

 IBM DOORS module fails to open in exclusive edit mode results in error "unable to open module ...no such file or directory" - United States missing session file; file not found; can not open module; open module exclusive edit fails; PM50525 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to open a module exclusive edit in IBM Rational DOORS result in the error "DOORS report
Unable to open module '/A Project/Requirements' No such file or directory". 

SYMPTOM
A module with a large number of sections is used mostly in shareable edit mode. 

You can open the module Read-only , or Shareable-Edit; but not in exclusive edit. 

Steps to reproduce: 

 1. Login to DOORS
    
    
 2. Click the Project, or folder, icon that contains the module
    
    
 3. Click the module icon in the DOORS Explorer window
    
    
 4. Click File > Open> Exclusive Edit (Ctrl + E)
    


Expected result: The module should open in Exclusive edit mode.  

Actual result: The module will not open in exclusive edit module; however it will open in read only mode, or shareable edit mode. If you attempt to check the database integrity for issue the module is not flagged for any problems. 

The full error message is as follows:

DOORS report
Unable to open module '/A Project/Requirements' No such file or directory"
C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\Rational\DOORS\9.5\data\v6data\20\m00000021.mod\current.ver\s1000005.dtc

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21511831&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21511831&aid=1]

CAUSE
 This issue has been identified as a product defect under APAR PM50525 [http://ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM31236].



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This error indicates that a user session file is corrupted on the database server. 

This defect is resolved in IBM Rational DOORS Version 9.4.0.1 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27036720#9401] 

 

WORKAROUND: 

the following options can be used to correct this problem: 

 * Retrieve the missing file from system backup and insert it into the module current.ver directory
   
   The advantage of inserting the missing session file is you do not need to restart the database server.

Warning these two option should only be performed by Rational Support. Modifications to the files in your DOORS database could result is data corruption and jeapordize your DOORS database. Send the session.ixc file to support for repair

From the module directory listed in the error message provide support the file session.ixc
Choosing to have support repair the session index file requires you to have all users log out 
and shut down the DOORS database server until the repaired file is returned and inserted 
to replace the existing data file for the module.

Create a replacement session file 
From the module directory listed in the error message provide support the file session.ixc
Adjacent session files will be required in order to to create the replacement. 
Your support engineer will identify these files from the session index file.
No work can be performed in the effected module until the replacement session file is restored
for the effected module.  


Note: Generally the repair is only required for one user session file. However in circumstances where DOORS reports a missing session file for a module- the event that caused this may have effected session files for other users connected to the module. For this situation you may need to perform a successive repair to the index file.

 IBM Data Server Manager (DSM) showing SQLCODE=-206 "<name> is not valid in the context where it is used." - United States SQLCODE 206 -206 SQL0206 SQL0206N DSM incompatible db2level fixpack fix pack db2iupdt TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Data Server Manager log files are full of SQLCODE=-206 "<name> is not valid in the context where it
is used." error 

SYMPTOM
The symptoms can vary depending on each installation. 

Most common scenario, DSM shows Data Pending status for the monitored database.


CAUSE
When you apply a new DB2 fixpack, the db2iupdt command is used to update an instance to a higher level within a release. 

But that command does not necessarily update the database system catalog to support the new fix pack that you have installed.
Meaning, just because the db2level shows a higher level, your database can still be using routines from an older DB2 level. 



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
One way to verify what routine levels your database is using, you can run the following DB2 command on the monitored database: 

db2 "select versionnumber from sysibm.sysversions order by 1 desc" 

If the results is showing a lower level than the ones DSM supports, that means your environment
is not supported, and you are getting the SQLCODE=-206 error.

To verify what are the DB2 levels supported by DSM, please refer to the links below:
- System requirements for IBM Data Server Manager, version 1.1.2 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27045176]
- System requirements for IBM Data Server Manager, version 2.1 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27048115]



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Run the db2updvnn command according to the db2level of your monitored database: 

- For DB2 V9.7 run db2updv97 [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEPGG_9.7.0/com.ibm.db2.luw.admin.cmd.doc/doc/r0054449.html] command
- For DB2 V10.1 run db2updv10 [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEPGG_11.1.0/com.ibm.db2.luw.admin.cmd.doc/doc/r0054449.html] command
- For DB2 V10.5 run db2updv105 [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEPGG_11.1.0/com.ibm.db2.luw.admin.cmd.doc/doc/r0054449.html] command

Problem: If your virtual system pattern includes a component (such as an image, software component or script package) that has a data dependency on another component, but does not have any locked attributes, then the attributes for the component with the data dependency are not presented for configuration during pattern deployment.

Resolution: To show missing component attributes for configuration, lock any one of the attributes, such as the name attribute. This action causes the other component attributes to be displayed for configuration. 

 IBM HTTP Session time-out settings and overwrite precedence rules - United States WebSphere http session management time-out wasrun precedence overwrite TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 It is possible to set the HTTP Session time-out in various places on the IBM® WebSphere® Application Server Administrative Console. It is also possible to set HTTP Session time-out for the application packaging process. 

Since Session time-out can be set in multiple places, it is necessary to understand how the ultimate Session time-out for an application is determined. 

CAUSE
Application needs HTTP session time-out set.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The HTTP Session time-out can be set in the following places: 

 * From the Administrative Console at the server, Enterprise application, and Web application levels 
 * At the time when the application is packaged 
 * In the application code


Setting the HTTP Session time-out from the Administrative Console 
1. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the server level, navigate to Servers > Application Servers > Your Server > Web Container > Session Management. 

In the Session time-out section of this window, you can select No time-out or Set time-out by clicking the appropriate radio button. If you choose to set the time-out, type the desired value in minutes in the box. 


2. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the Enterprise Application level, navigate to Applications > Enterprise Applications > Your Application > Session Management. 

Check Override in the Override Session Management section, then select to set the time-out and the time-out value. This sets the application session to overwrite those values set at the parent, which in this case is the Server level. 


3. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the Web Application level, navigate to Applications > Enterprise Applications > Your Application > Web Module > Your Web App.war > Session Management. 

Check Override in the Override Session Management section, then select to set the time-out and the time-out value. This sets the Application Session to overwrite those values set at the parent levels, which in this case is the Server or Enterprise Application level. 

After modifying these settings, save the master configuration. 

Setting HTTP Session time-out when application is packaged 

The application developer can also select to set the HTTP Session time-out parameter when the application is packaged. This value is stored in the web.xml file for the Web application. 

This setting overrides any session time-outs defined from the Administrative Console. Alter this setting by repackaging the application with a new value, or by modifying the web.xml file. The entry in the web.xml will be as follows: 
          <session-config> 
      *          <session-timeout>60</session-timeout>
 * 
 *       </session-config>

 

Where the "session-timeout" is an integer value for the desired session time-out in minutes. 
Setting HTTP Session time-out from the application code 

Finally, the HTTP Session time-out can be set in the application code. The programmer can invoke the setMaxInactiveInterval() method on HttpSession object to set the time-out value as desired. This setting overrides any time-out defined in the application package or made from the Administrative Console. 

HTTP Session time-out Override Precedence Summary 

The list below shows the precedence from which the final HTTP Session time-out is derived. 

1. Server Level [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21163875&amp;aid=1] Lowest level 2. Enterprise Application [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21163875&amp;aid=1] Overrides the Server Level if Override is selected 3. Web Application [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21163875&amp;aid=1] Overrides the Server and Enterprise Application settings if Override is selected 4. Application Level (web.xml) [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21163875&amp;aid=1] Overrides Server, Enterprise Application, and Web Application settings 5. Application Code [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21163875&amp;aid=1] Overrides all other settings RELATED INFORMATION

 IBM "An invalid XML character" error is thrown when handling data originating from a WebSphere Adapter - United States Unicode invalid character 0x0 xml serialize serialization XSLT XLS error TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 WeBSphere Adapter is unable to process data from a source containing unicode data due to a serialization error in the broker indicating that "An invalid XML character (Unicode: 0x0) was found in the element content". 

SYMPTOM
When processing data using a broker that originates from a WebSphere JCA Adapter, you encounter an exception of the following form: 

Source = java.lang.RuntimeException caught trying to serialize BO BusinessObject: F4211BeginDoc@382a382a (F4211FSBeginDoc=F4211FSBeginDoc@67e667e6) probeid = 214 Stack Dump = java.lang.RuntimeException: An invalid XML character (Unicode: 0x0) was found in the element content:

This error occurs while you are performing data transformations within your broker, either for an XSLT or to enable monitoring or tracing of the data stream, and results in a flow failure.


CAUSE
The problem occurs when the source data contains unicode data which is not allowed in XML. In the above example, this is the unicode character 0x0, but there are a number of other unicode characters that can cause the same result. The problem does not occur in the WebSphere Adapter itself because the WebSphere Adapters are entirely capable of handling full unicode data. Rather, the problem happens in some brokers which fail to properly serialize the incoming data into a valid XML object.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The only complete solution at this time is to not process unicode characters that are not valid in XML. This can be done by not importing data fields that might contain such characters or by purging such characters from the incoming data source. It is not sufficient to do filtering in the BO maps since the broker can still run into problems prior to this Java™ mapping. 


If handling of fields containing these unicode characters is essential to your use case, it will be necessary to open a PMR with your broker's support team (rather than the WebSphere Adapter team) to determine if there are any alternatives available.

 IBM ERROR: Default DB path is not set, when adding database set on RHEL 5 - United States 1320206; ClearQuest; Command Line Tools; CQ; cqreg; add_dbset; initialize; CQ_DATABASES; CQDB_rgys; registry; db set; db_set; Default DB path is not set; Use cqreg initialize first; linux; RHEL; RHEL5 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote explains why the error, "Default DB path is not set", occurs when adding a connection with IBM® Rational® ClearQuest® on RedHat Enterprise Linux® (RHEL) 5. 

SYMPTOM
When running the command cqreg add_dbset, this error occurs:

"Default DB path is not set"
"Default version is 7.0.0"
/opt/rational/clearquest/CQDB_rgys/cqdb_registry/7.0.0 does not exist. Use cqreg initialize first. 

CAUSE
Normally, at the end of a ClearQuest installation on UNIX® based platforms, the cqreg initialize command runs automatically. The command creates the registry structure for database sets. During the installation, the command did not run successfully.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Verify that the CQDB_rgys directory exists, as defined in the installation options. The following is the default registry location: 


/opt/rational/clearquest/CQDB_rgys/cqdb_registry/

If not present, then the cqreg initialize command was not successful.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Run cqreg initialize. The add_dbset command will run successfully afterwards. However, should the same error persist, make sure the command is run as the root user. 



Also make sure that the CQ_DATABASES environment variable is set to the desired registry path. If it is not, set the variable accordingly, then run the previously mentioned commands again. 

 IBM PureData Systems for Analytics - nzsql error, Records trailing spring space set to 512 is too small - United States netezza PDA TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What does the message "ERROR: Records trailing spring space set to 512 is too small..." mean? 

ANSWER
The following error may appear in the pg.log file: 

ERROR: Records trailing spring space set to 512 is too small : Bump it up using the environment variable NZ_SPRINGFIELD_SIZE 

This error can occur when a query includes multiple aggregates against varchar or nvarchar columns. As the query is being processed the system allocates memory for each row of the result set. This includes each of the GROUP BY columns and each of the aggregates. For queries doing aggregates on variable length columns, the total length of the record will vary during the process. For example, if the current min value is "Boston" and the new min value is "Albuquerque" space for the new min value needs to increase. 

The NZ_SPRINGFIELD_SIZE is an extra pseudo-column that is tacked onto each row. It does not contain any data. It is a filler that starts out at NZ_SPRINGFIELD_SIZE and then dynamically shrinks and expands as needed to keep each of the aggregate rows at a fixed length. There is a single springfield in each grouping record that has to shrink and grow to offset the combined changes in width of the running values for all min/max aggregates. 

To avoid this error message, increase the value for this parameter as follows: 

1. nzstop
2. export NZ_SPRINGFIELD_SIZE=1024
3. nzstart 

You can confirm that the environment variable took effect by running the command "nzsystem showregistry". The output should contain the following: "system.maxSpringFieldSize = 1024". 

Unfortunately, the setting for NZ_SPRINGFIELD_SIZE will revert to its default value the next time the database is stopped and started without the NZ_SPRINGFIELD_SIZE environment variable being set. To ensure that the setting persists after every database restart, do the following:
1. Add the following line to the /nz/data/config/system.cfg file. (Create the file if it does not exist.) 

system.maxSpringFieldSize = 1024
2. nzstop
3. nzstart 

If 1024 does not work, try higher values. Setting the limit may take a little trial and error. Increasing this value should not have a noticeable impact on other system performance. 

 

Note: "By default 512 bytes is allocated to each row taking part in aggregations. By increasing this value by 512 we allocate over 30MB more memory for every 1 000 000 rows participating in aggregations. This is for one query, there might be other queries in the system which do aggregations as well. The more memory that is allocated for NZ_SPRINGFIELD_SIZE (for each row) the less memory left for other processes. Having said this, it is not uncommon to see NZ_SPRINGFIELD_SIZE set to 8192 without consequence but care must be taken and one must still be aware of how increasing NZ_SPRINGFIELD_SIZE will impact resources, thus increase it wisely. "

CAUSE

The Admin user exists on Base Portal but not the Realm which is configured to Virtual Portal.

The Administrator User who is listed as the Domain Admin retrieved with:

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

The Admin user has to be made visible on both base and virtual Portals if you wish to syndicate between the two.

When syndicating to Virtual Portals, the Administrator User who is listed as the Domain Admin retrieved with:
com.presence.connect.wmmcomms.UserManagementServiceImpl.getPortalAdministrator() should have access to the Virtual Portal.

6.2.2.3-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0003
---------------------------------
APAR: IV60709
Abstract: NO CPU DATA WHEN HMC TIME ZONE IS SET TO BST
Additional information: If the Hardware Management Console (HMC)
time zone is set to BST, data might not be collected.
The data provider might use the incorrect time zone
because BST can represent more than one time zone, for
example, British Summer Time and Bangladesh Standard
Time. When the data provider sends the commands to the
HMC to collect the CPU data, the start and stop times of
the commands might not be correct and might not receive
any data. Also, data might be collected, but for the
wrong time frame. 

6.2.2.3-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0002
---------------------------------
Feature: 208626
Abstract: LPAR Memory Attributes
Additional information: The following new attributes are added in
the Server LPARs attribute group:

Current_Memory - The current amount of memory, in megabytes,
configured for the LPAR.
Warehouse name: CM0
Running_Memory - The amount of memory, in megabytes, varied on-line
by the LPAR.
Warehouse name: RM

In order to display these new attributes in the Tivoli Enterprise
Portal, use the Query Editor and select Server LPARs_V9 under
KPH SERVER LPARS.

6.2.2.3-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0001
---------------------------------

APAR: IV47101
Abstract: NO CPU DATA DUE TO TIME OUTS ON HMC SSH CALLS
Additional information: In large environments, where there are more
than 150 LPARs on a server, the CPU Units used and CPU
Used Pct might display "Not Collected." The
kph_data_provider_<instance>_0.log displays the
following message: 
--
SEVERE: SSHCommandExecutor.call: Timed out while waiting
for `lslparutil -m "<server>" -r "lpar" -s s -F
'lpar_id|time|time_cycles |
entitled_cycles|capped_cycles|uncapped_cycles| idle_cycles'
--

APAR: IV50134
Abstract: NO CPU DATA WHEN HMC TIME SET TO GMT FORMAT
Additional information: If the HMC time zone is set to a GMT format,
for example, GMT-08:00, CPU data might not be collected
because the data provider does not recognize the GMT
format and will default to using the local time zone. 
When the data provider sends the commands to the HMC to
collect the CPU data, the start and stop times of the
commands might not be correct and might not receive any
data. It is also possible that data will be collected,
but for the wrong time frame.

APAR: IV50135
Abstract: NO DATA IN MEMORY AND PAGING SPACE VIEW
Additional information: The System workspace might not display any
data in the Memory and Paging Space views. This can
happen when the HMC commands:
---
monhmc -r swap -n 0
monhmc -r mem -n 0
---
return data in M bytes instead of k bytes:
---
Swap: 1992M total, 0M used, 1992M free, 2853M cached 
Mem: 24336M total, 4534M used, 19801M free, 480M buffers
---

APAR: IV50686
Abstract: NO CPU DATA IN NON-ENGLISH LOCALE
Additional information: When the agent runs in a non-English locale,
attributes "CPU Units Used" and "CPU Used Pct" might
display as "Not Collected" due to a Java problem. The
kph_data_provider_0.log will have a message similar to
this: 
---
WARNING: 
ManagementConsoleInventoryItemBuilder$BasicDataCommand.
processResult: An error occurred while parsing the N2 date
field "Fri Sep 27 11:35:31 JST 2013". Continuing. 
---

2.2 Defects
---------------
Defect: 207939
Abstract: Java CPCI - deadlock due to bad lock usage in some versions
of Java runtime
Additional information: Classloading and resource loading might get
locks in the wrong order, due to Java APAR IZ96933, 
causing the data provider to stop collecting data. This
fix prevents the problem no matter what version of Java is
running.

Defect: 208541
Abstract: Add log messages to show data sent to kphagent
Additional information: At log level of FINEST, show the contents of
the rows of data sent from the data provider to the 
kphagent process.

5.0 Installation instructions 
==================
This fix can only be installed over an existing installation. Use
the following steps to install this fix.

5.1 Before installing the fix 
------------------------------
- The prerequisites listed under section 3.1 entitled 'Prerequisites
for this fix' must be installed before this fix can be installed.

- For the purpose of this README, the symbol <CANDLEHOME> is the 
IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory. The default value
for CANDLEHOME is '/opt/IBM/ITM' on UNIX systems and 'C:\IBM\ITM'
on Windows systems.

Before installing this fix on UNIX systems, set the environment 
variable CANDLEHOME to the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation 
directory.

For example: 
> CANDLEHOME=/opt/IBM/ITM 
> export CANDLEHOME

- Because there is no uninstall utility for this fix, make sure to
perform a backup of your environment before installing this fix.

5.2 Local agent update
--------------------------
1. Transfer the appropriate archive file
(6.2.2.3-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004.tar or .zip) to a temporary
directory on the system that contains the agent code to be
updated. For the purpose of this README, the symbol <TEMP>
represents the fully qualified path to this directory. Note: On
Windows systems, this path includes the drive letter.

2. Expand the archive file using the "tar" command on UNIX systems or 
an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a
directory structure that contains fixes for all of the supported
platforms.

3. Use the "itmpatch" command to install the fix for the operating
system for that agent. For more information on the "itmpatch"
command, see section 6.2. 

On UNIX systems, if the fix was expanded to 
<TEMP>/6.2.2.3-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004, the install command is:

> itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> 
-i <TEMP>/6.2.2.3-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004/kph_aix526_tema_if0004.tar

5.3 Remote agent update
----------------------------
1. Transfer the appropriate archive file
(6.2.2.3-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004.tar or .zip) to a temporary
directory on the IBM Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server system.
For the purpose of this README, the symbol <TEMP> represents the
fully qualified path to this directory. Note: On Windows systems,
this path includes the drive letter.

2. Expand the archive file using the "tar" command on UNIX systems or 
an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a
directory structure that contains fixes for all of the supported
platforms.

3. To add the agent fix bundles into the remote deploy depot, use the
"tacmd addBundles" command found in $CANDLEHOME/bin on UNIX systems
or in %CANDLE_HOME%\bin on Windows systems. For more information
on the "tacmd addBundles" command, see the IBM Tivoli Monitoring
Administrator's Guide.

On UNIX systems, 
if the fix was expanded to <TEMP>/6.2.2.3-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004:
> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd addBundles -n -i <TEMP>/6.2.2.3-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004

On Windows systems, 
if the fix was expanded to <TEMP>\6.2.2.3-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004:
> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd addBundles -n -i <TEMP>\6.2.2.3-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004

where:
-n indicates that prerequisite bundles are not automatically
added. The -n parameter must be used because the fix 
directory does not contain any prerequisites that the fix
might require. Please see Section 3.1 for the prerequisites
for this fix.
-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to be
added to the depot. 

4. To log in to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring server, and deploy
the fix to the appropriate nodes where the agent is running, use
the following "tacmd" commands. For more information on the
"tacmd login" and "tacmd updateAgent" commands, see the IBM Tivoli
Monitoring Administrator's Guide.

On UNIX systems: 
> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>
-u <itmuser> 
-p <password>

> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems

The output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the
remote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the
"tacmd updateAgent" command.

> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd updateAgent -t ph
-n <Managed system name>
-v 062203004

On Windows systems:
> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd login -s <server>
-u <itmuser> 
-p <password>

> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd listSystems

The output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the
remote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the
"tacmd updateAgent" command.

> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd updateAgent -t PH 
-n <Managed system name> 
-v 062203004

Note:
- The component (-t) for the "tacmd updateAgent" command is
specified as two characters (PH), not three characters (KPH).
- The node (-n) for the "tacmd updateAgent" command is the managed
system name of the operating system (OS) agent to be updated.
The target node for the "tacmd updateAgent" command is always
an OS agent.

5.4 Agent support update
------------------------------

This fix 6.2.2.2-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004 includes changes to the agent
support files which need to be installed. Use the following steps to
update the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server, Tivoli Enterprise
Portal Server, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop.

1. Transfer the appropriate archive file
(6.2.2.2-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004.tar or .zip) to the Tivoli
Enterprise Monitoring Servers, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Servers,
or Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktops.

2. Expand the archive file using the "tar" command on UNIX systems
or an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a
directory structure that contains fixes for all of the supported
platforms.

3. Expand the archive file (kph_tems_teps_tepd_if0004.tar or .zip)
that contains the updates for Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server,
Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, and Tivoli Enterprise Portal
Desktop using the "tar" command on UNIX systems or an extract
utility on Windows systems. This step creates a directory
structure that includes a subdirectory called CD-ROM, with the
necessary updates.

4. Use the Application Support Installer(ASI) GUI or the silent
installation method to install the application support files.

Note: For IBM Tivoli Monitoring Version 6.3 or above, one
of the following additional steps must be performed.

1. Acquire a platform-specific pre-packaged JRE version
of the Application Support Installer (ASI). See IBM
Tivoli Monitoring Application Support Installer,
6.2-tiv-itm_asi-if0003 at

http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034924 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034924]

for download and installation instructions.

-- OR --

2. Specify the '-j javahome' parameter with the path to
a Java(r) 1.5 or java 1.6 installation when running
the itmasi.sh or itmasi.bat script described below.

GUI installation option
------------------------
The GUI can be started by using one of the following commands
from within the CD-ROM directory where setup.jar is located.

On UNIX systems:
> ./itmasi.sh [-h <CANDLEHOME>] [-j <JAVAHOME>]

On Windows systems:
> itmasi [-h <CANDLEHOME>] [-j <JAVAHOME>]

When prompted by the Application Support Installer for the
installable media directory, select the CD-ROM directory, not the
component directory. The installer can install updates for
multiple components at the same time.

Silent installation option
--------------------------
To use the silent installation option, use one of the following
commands from within the CD-ROM directory where setup.jar is
located.

Note: Using the silent installation option for Linux and zLinux
operating systems requires the following files contained in
interim fix 6.2-TIV-ITM_ASI-IF0001:
- Linux: setupLinux.bin
- zLinux: setupLinux390.bin
Follow the installation instructions contained in the
"6.2-TIV-ITM_ASI-IF0001.README".

On UNIX systems:
> ./itmasi.sh -h <CANDLEHOME>[-silent]
[-r <response file>]
[-j <JAVAHOME>]

On Windows systems:
> itmasi -h <CANDLEHOME> [-silent]
[-r <response file>]
[-j <JAVAHOME>]

where:
-h <CANDLEHOME> - Required. The path to the IBM Tivoli
Monitoring installation directory.

-r <response file> - Optional. Customized response file name.
The default response file "response.txt" in
the CD-ROM directory can be copied and modified
for your environment. Do not update "response.txt".

-j <JAVAHOME> - Optional. The fully-qualified path to the "bin"
directory where Java(R) is installed. The
location of Java on your system might vary.

5. The next panel presented by the Application Support Installer asks
for the selection of which Tivoli Monitoring components you want
to add application support to. For this fix, check or clear the
check boxes as follows:

checked - Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server (TEMS)
checked - Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server (TEPS)
checked - Tivoli Enterprise Desktop Client (TEPD)

Continue through the remaining GUI panels selecting the HMC Base
06.22.03.04 support to complete the installation.

6. If the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop or Tivoli Enterprise Portal
Browser was running when the update was installed, it must be
restarted.


6.0 Additional installation information
========================

For additional troubleshooting installation information, see the
itmpatch.log in the patchlogs directory in <CANDLEHOME>.

6.1 Installation instructions for agent baroc file
-----------------------------------------------------
This fix 6.2.2.2-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004 includes changes to the
agent baroc files that must be installed. Refer to IBM Tivoli
Monitoring Installation and Setup Guide under "Installing monitoring
agent baroc files on the event server" in "Installing the IBM Tivoli
Enterprise Console Event Synchronization" section for more
information.

6.2 Additional information on using "itmpatch" command
--------------------------------------------------------------
The "itmpatch" command has the following syntax:

Usage: itmpatch -h <installation home> [OPTIONS]

itmpatch -h <installation home>
-t { <patch_file_directory> | <patch_file> }

itmpatch -h <installation home>
-i { <patch_file_directory> | <patch_file> }

where:
-h Specifies the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory
-i Specifies the path to the directory or patch file to be installed
-t Generates a report of the actions to be taken by the patch


For example, on UNIX systems:
- To preview the fix installation, use the "-t" option:
> <CANDLEHOME>/bin/itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> -t <TEMP>

- To install the fix, use the "-i" option:
> <CANDLEHOME>/bin/itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> -i <TEMP>

where:
<CANDLEHOME> is the fully qualified IBM Tivoli Monitoring
installation directory. On Windows systems, this path must include
the drive letter.
<TEMP> represents the fully qualified directory specification where
the fix is located. On Windows systems, this must include the drive
letter.

6.3 Verifying the update
----------------------------

1. To verify the agent was updated correctly, use the "tacmd" command
to view the agent's current version after the agent is restarted.
You are required to log in to a Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring
Server prior to viewing the agent version.

For example:
On UNIX systems, where $CANDLEHOME is the IBM Tivoli Monitoring
installation directory, the default location is '/opt/IBM/ITM'. 

> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>
-u <itmuser> 
-p <password>
> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems -t PH

On Windows systems, where %CANDLE_HOME% is the IBM Tivoli
Monitoring installation directory, the default location
is 'C:\IBM\ITM'. 

> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd login -s <server>
-u <itmuser> 
-p <password>

> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd listSystems -t PH 

Note: The component (-t) for the "tacmd listSystems" command is
specified as two characters (PH), not three characters (KPH).

When the agent update is successful, the agent version is:
06.22.03.04.

2. To verify the agent support files were updated correctly, use the
"kincinfo" command on Windows systems or the "cinfo" command on
Linux or UNIX systems. The sample output below shows the versions
of the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, Tivoli Enterprise
Monitoring Server, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop systems
after this fix has been successfully applied.

Note: The displayed date of the build might not be accurate. This
is a known problem.

On UNIX or Linux systems:
-------------------------
To validate that all components have been installed, run the
following command:

./cinfo -i

 [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21674407&amp;aid=3] 




ARE THESE PRODUCTS STILL SUPPORTED WHEN THEY ARE BUNDLED WITH ANOTHER IBM PRODUCT?

 * Yes, support is available for all bundled components until the IBM product that includes them is withdrawn from support. However, they are only supported when used by the bundling IBM product. Unrelated usage is not supported.

IS THE WEBSPHERE MQ V7.0 RESOURCE ADAPTER SUPPORTED IN WEBSPHERE APPLICATION SERVER?

 * Yes, the WebSphere MQ V7.0 Resource Adapter [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21248089#7dotx_0] shipped with WebSphere Application Server V8.0 and V7.0 is supported through 30 April 2018 [https://www.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?subtype=ca&infotype=an&appname=iSource&supplier=897&letternum=ENUS916-143], when both of those versions of WebSphere Application Server end support, or longer if you purchase a WebSphere Application Server support extension.
   
 * Similarly, the WebSphere MQ V7.1 Resource Adapter [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21248089#7dotx_0_0] shipped with WebSphere Application Server V8.5.x is supported as long as that version of WebSphere Application Server remains in support, or longer if you purchase a WebSphere Application Server support extension.
   
 * However, if you manually install your own copy of the WebSphere MQ V7.x Resource Adapter in WebSphere Application Server or any third-party Java EE server, it will go out of support with the corresponding WebSphere MQ server version.
   
 * The IBM MQ V8.0 and V9.0 Resource Adapters cannot be installed in WebSphere Application Server V8.5.x, V8.0 and V7.0 because those versions support JMS 1.1 while the IBM MQ Resource Adapters implement JMS 2.0. WebSphere Application Server V9.0 ships with the IBM MQ V9.0 Resource Adapter [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21248089#7dotx_0_0_0] and includes full support for JMS 2.0. The version of MQ Resource Adapter you use must be supported by your Java EE server but does not need to match the version of the queue managers to which you wish to connect.

 IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in Diffie-Hellman ciphers affects IBM Image Construction and CompositionTool. (CVE-2015-4000) - United States  SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The Logjam Attack on TLS connections using the Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange protocol affects IBM Image Construction and Composition Tool. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-4000 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-4000]
DESCRIPTION: The TLS protocol could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to properly convey a DHE_EXPORT ciphersuite choice. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to force a downgrade to 512-bit export-grade cipher. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to recover the session key as well as modify the contents of the traffic. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Logjam".
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103294 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103294] for the current score

You should verify applying this configuration change does not cause any compatibility issues. If you change the default setting after applying the fix, you will expose yourself to the attack described above. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled the Diffie-Hellman key-exchange protocol used in TLS and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions.

 IBM Couldn't validate parameters error logging in with IBM Datacap - United States login connect couldnt validate parameters TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Users are unable to log in with any client to any application. The Taskmaster Server (tms) log shows:

Connect couldn't validate parameters 

SYMPTOM
This is most commonly seen on a new installed Taskmaster Server. Users attempting to login will receive a message stating that they cannot connect to the admin database.


CAUSE
Encryption is not yet fully set up, so FIPS key information cannot be located.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If this is a new server where Datacap has never been run and encryption has not been set up at all, follow the instructions at Exporting encryption keys [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZRWV_9.0.1/com.ibm.dc.install.doc/dcain011_copyto_cs1.htm].


If this is an existing server or a new server where the previous steps have been completed, distribute the dc_ktf.xml file to the client folder for all clients that will be used following the instructions at Importing encryption keys to Datacap computers [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZRWV_9.0.1/com.ibm.dc.install.doc/dcain010_copyto_wtminstall1.htm].

 IBM Identify the application that has a WMQ queue opened - United States Identify application program connected queue TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Your WebSphere MQ queue manager will not stop if there are applications that still have a queue opened. Your goal is to allow a graceful stop of the queue manager, also called controlled (or quiesced) shutdown. 

For example, the following runmqsc command for the queue Q1 shows that there is an application currently that has opened a queue, but it does not provide application name, or process id number (PID). The value for OPPROCS indicates 1 application has opened the queue for output (for doing a PUT).

display qstatus(Q1)
1 : display qstatus(Q1)
AMQ8450: Display queue status details.
QUEUE(Q1) TYPE(QUEUE)
CURDEPTH(0) IPPROCS(0)
LGETDATE( ) LGETTIME( )
LPUTDATE( ) LPUTTIME( )
MEDIALOG( ) MONQ(OFF)
MSGAGE( ) OPPROCS(1)
QTIME( , ) UNCOM(NO)

You want to determine the name of the application that currently has a queue open, 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use the runmqsc display connection command to find the process id (PID) and application name. 

Using the above example of the queue Q1, this is the complete command to invoke under runmqsc: 


display conn(*) where(objname eq Q1) all

Example output:

AMQ8276: Display Connection details.
CONN(ACBDC64820001B01)
EXTCONN(414D5143514D5F414E47454C494C4C4F)
TYPE(CONN)
PID(7364)TID(1)
APPLTAG(WebSphere MQ\bin\amqsput.exe)APPLTYPE(USER)
ASTATE(NONE) CHANNEL( )
CONNAME( ) CONNOPTS(MQCNO_SHARED_BINDING)
USERID(x) UOWLOG( )
UOWSTDA( ) UOWSTTI( )
UOWLOGDA( ) UOWLOGTI( )
URTYPE(QMGR)
EXTURID(XA_FORMATID[00000000] XA_GTRID[] XA_BQUAL[])
QMURID(0.0) UOWSTATE(NONE)

The following fields are of interest:
PID(7364) => Process id
APPLTAG(WebSphere MQ\bin\amqsput.exe) => name of the application
USERID(x) => Userid that has invoked the application


For UNIX users:

One of the main purposes for the above technique is to eventually kill the process that is connected to the queue manager. 

a) One option is to use the STOP CONN command under runmqsc. Using the above example, the corresponding command would be:
STOP CONN(ACBDC64820001B01)

b) The following SupportPac can be used to identify the applications and kill them if desired:

MS6B: WebSphere MQ Connection Management Utility [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?&uid=swg24017810]
This SupportPac is Category 4 (which means that the IBM MQ Support team does not support it)

 IBM System Requirements for WebSphere MQ V8.0 - United States  PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION

ABSTRACT
 This document contains system requirements for WebSphere MQ V8.0 and a note about IBM WebSphere MQ Advanced entitlement. 

CONTENT
IBM has provided customers with a Software Product Compatibility Reports (SPCR) tool where you can locate and find complete lists of supported operating systems, system requirements, prerequisites, and optional supported software for WebSphere MQ 8.0. 

RHEL Compatible OS. Defect support is available for Linux environments that are fully compatible - both source and binary - with Red Hat Enterprise Linux V6. Unless stated otherwise, WebSphere MQ has not been specifically tested in such compatible environments. WebSphere MQ Support is therefore unable to assist in issues related to configuration and setup, or issues that are directly related to the linux environment itself. If issues arise that are related to the compatible linux environment, the user may need to contact the linux environment vendor for support, or the issue may need to be recreated inside an environment tested by IBM in order to receive WebSphere MQ support. 

Virtualization. Defect support is available for virtualization environments where they relate to releases of this platform already supported by WebSphere MQ. Unless stated elsewhere in the system requirements WebSphere MQ has not been specifically tested in virtualization environments. 

WebSphere MQ support is therefore unable to assist in issues related to configuration and setup, or issues that are directly related to the virtualization environment itself. 

Please also refer to:
WebSphere MQ's support position on Virtualization, low-level hardware, file systems on networks and high availability. [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21392025]


The SPCR tool links to information about the minimum product levels that must be installed before opening a problem report with IBM WebSphere MQ Technical Support. The software versions and any maintenance levels listed in the tool have been explicitly verified as working.


Supported System Requirements:

 IBM Upgrading to Jazz for Service Management Version 1.1.3.0 using Installation Manager results in a permission denied error - United States jazzsm1130relnotes TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When upgrading Jazz for Service Management to Version 1.1.3.0 using Installation Manager, the installation fails with the following error:

Cannot run program "/space/IBM/JazzSM/ui/bin/wrapper.sh" (in directory "/space/IBM/JazzSM/ui/bin"): error=13, Permission denied [/space/IBM/JazzSM/install/tip/tipWrapp
erInstall.xml:215] 

CAUSE
During the upgrade process the non-root user does not have the correct permissions to run the shell script. This is due to the following:
1. Jazz for Service Management is installed as a non-root user
2. Installation Manager is installed in user mode through root user


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The upgrade must be initiated by using the attached script, which gives the non-root user (who originally installed this Jazz for Service Management instance) the correct permissions for the upgrade process. 


The script takes two mandatory arguments and one optional argument.

Usage: ./JazzSMgrpModeUpgrade.sh "IM_Install_Location" 
"JazzSM_Install_Location [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEKCU_1.1.3.0/com.ibm.psc.doc/ref/psc_r_pathnames.html]""[Response_file_with_absolute_Path]"

For example (showing default installation paths): ./JazzSMgrpModeUpgrade.sh "/home/root/IBM/InstallManager/" "/opt/IBM/JazzSM/" "/opt/Download/dash_upgrade_rsp.xml"


For IM GUI mode installation, provide the 2 mandatory arguments; IM_Install_Location and JazzSM_Install_Location. 
This argument combination invokes Installation Manager in GUI mode and lead you through the rest of the upgrade process.

For IM Silent installation, provide all 3 arguments; IM_Install_Location , JazzSM_Install_Location, and Response_file_with_absolute_Path.
This argument combination invokes Installation Manager in silent mode to upgrade JazzSM.

 IBM How to include Rational Rhapsody external source files into configuration MakeFile - United States external; AddToMakefile; build; make; File element; MakeFile; external object; external objects; make file TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How can you configure the default setting of IBM Rational Rhapsody Developer Edition for C++ (RiC++) in order to include external source files into MakeFile? 

CAUSE
In some cases, you want to import legacy source files into Rhapsody models as external elements. For those externally imported elements (classes and files), Rhapsody doesn't generate code, hence you can preserve legacy code as part of your existing model. However, by default, Rhapsody excludes those external elements from the build even though you turn CG::File::AddToMakefile [File::AddToMakefile] property on.

ANSWER
For general information regarding code generation for external elements, see "Code generation for external elements [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/rhaphlp/v8/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.rhp.uml.diagrams.doc%2Ftopics%2Frhp_r_dm_cd_genrtion_extnl_elmts.html]" topic in Rhapsody Info Center. This technote will provide 3 solutions to allow the inclusion of external elements into the build. 


Solution 1 - Use Component File element 

 * 
 * 
 * Add source file to the build
 * 


Solution 2 - Use File/Class element 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *  Add a Class/File element to map the external source code into the model. Set property CG::Class::UseAsExternal as "checked" for the added element. Set property CG::File::AddToMakefile [File::AddToMakefile] as "checked". Set the path to the external file in property CG::Class:FileName to make Rhapsody aware the location of the external source code. The path info would be used in MakeFile generated by Rhapsody.
   
   Note: Both absolute and relative path are supported. Right click the model element, from context menu, click Add New > SourceArtifact.
   
   Note: In order to include this external model element into MakeFile, SourceArtifact is required for the external model element. To enable the display of SourceArtifact, make sure Top Menu > View > Browser Display Options > Show Source Artifacts is checked.
   Make sure the type of added SourceArtifact is set either "Logical" or "Implementation" (DO NOT choose "Specification"). 
   Rename SourceArtifact with the name of the external source code (e.g. rename the element to "hoo", if the external file name is "hoo.cpp"). Click [Elements] tab of the SourceArtifact to make sure the model element is correctly mapped in SourceArtifact. In case of Class, the mapping will be done automatically. For File, manually add its parent element to [Elements] tab as below:
   
   [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21621937&amp;aid=1]
   
   IMPORTANT: You might occasionally find the behavior of File is not consistent with Class. This is because File element is designed to be used as external element only, and not supposed to be built from Rhapsody. You are encouraged to use external Class element in RiC++ model to avoid any confusion you might experience. Generate MakeFile to make sure the external source file (e.g. hoo.obj) file is being added in the build.
   

Solution 3 - Use Additional Sources setting 

 * 
 * 
 * [Additional Sources]
 * 
 * [Settings]
 * 
 *  
   
   Note:

PRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM
 IBMMQ 

 IBM Can't disable DASH TimeSet and dataRefresh in Events configuration - United States DASHL2; timeSet; dataRefresh; Events; WIdgets.; Pages TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Any Widget added to a Page after the initial "Save" or "Save and Exit" will not retain the Events settings when trying to disable the TimeSet and dataRefresh Events in the Edit -> Events pull down configuration window. 

SYMPTOM
TimeSet and dataRefresh Events can't be disabled after any "Save" for previous added Widgets on a Page.


CAUSE
This has been identified as a product defect under APAR IV83442

ENVIRONMENT
Any DASH version, this was a problem since DASH 3.1.0

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Create a Page in DASH, add Widgets then save and exit. Access the Page again, edit the page to add another Widget, Edit the Events in the new Widget then unselect the TimeSet and dataRefresh options. Save the changes.


Edit the new Page:

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21984540&amp;aid=1]

Unselect the TimeSet and dataRefresh options.

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21984540&amp;aid=2]

After a "save" or "save and exit" you will see that they are enabled again. 


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21984540&amp;aid=3]


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Currently, the only workaround is to Place and configure the Events for all widgets wanted on the page before doing first "Save" or "Save and Exit". All widgets will retain values for subscribed events such as 'dataRefresh' and 'timeSet' 

To use 'dataRefresh' and 'timeSet' properties of subscribed events for any widgets which are added after first "Save" or "Save and Exit", DASH support will need to be contacted. 

Note: This issue is with the widgets which are placed on the page after first "Save" or "Save & Exit"

IBM SPSS Statistics 24 FixPack 2 for Mac OS X has a silent (push) installer. To install this FixPack on Mac systems, do the following: 

 1. Open the 24.0-IM-S24STATC-Mac-Silent-FP002.dmg disk image and copy the two files to your desktop (or any writable location). 
 2. Open a Terminal window and change directories to the location of the patch installer and installer.properties file. 
 3. Edit the installer.properties file to suit your needs. The USER_INSTALL_DIR parameter must be defined. For example, if the current SPSS Statistics 24 install is in the default /Applications/IBM/SPSS/Statistics/24, USER_INSTALL_DIR would be:
    USER_INSTALL_DIR=/Applications/IBM/SPSS/Statistics/24 
 4. Uncomment and modify other parameters as needed. 
 5. To execute the installer, use the following command:
    
    ./SPSS_Statistics_Installer_Silent.bin -f installer.properties


Installation Linux  1. Download the Fix Pack to a temporary location on your hard drive. 
 2. Ensure that no versions of Statistics are running. 
 3. Open a terminal window and execute the 24.0-IM-S24STATC-Linux8664-FP002.bin executable file as the ‘root’ user. 
 4. Statistics 24.0.0.2 is ready to run. Use the Help -> About menu to verify that 24.0.0.2 is the installed version.


Guidelines for unattended/pushed installations for Linux-based clients: The SPSS Statistics 24.0.0.2 for Linux Fix Pack obeys the same rules documented in the Site and Network License Administrator's Guides regarding "Running a Silent Installation on Mac and Linux Computers". 

Note: Please contact IBM SPSS Technical Support to obtain the appropriate installer.properties file for the Linux platform. 

SPSS Statistics Server - 24.0 FP2 Installation Instructions 

Installation Windows 

 1. Log in as a local administrator. 
 2. Download the Fix Pack contents to a temporary location. 
 3. Ensure that the same version of Statistics Server is not running, as multiple versions can be installed on the server. 
 4. Run the Statistics Server 24.0.02 Fix Pack executable. 
    Note: you must use "Run as Administrator" by first right-clicking on the executable. 
 5. SPSS Statistics Server 24.0.0.2 is ready to run. Check the service name or add/remove programs, or launch statisticsb and run the SHOW VERSION command to verify 24.0.0.2 as the installed version.


Installation UNIX/Linux Note: On UNIX and Linux, the Statistics Server upgrade is now a true incremental upgrade and not a complete, fresh installation. Installing the Fix Pack for the appropriate platform should be similar to the instructions for installing your server given in the SPSS Statistics Server Installation Instructions. It is suggested to copy off the spssdxcfg.ini prior to the installation on the UNIX / Linux server as the installation may remove the R section in spssdxcfg.ini and may require manual updating after FP2 installation 

 1. Download the Fix Pack to a directory on the server machine. 
 2. Shut down Statistics Server prior to applying the Fix Pack. 
 3. You need to ensure the ownership and permissions for the /bin, /lib and /common subdirectories of the Statistics installation directory. For example, if you installed as root, to change the ownership and permissions, go to Statistics installation directory and run the following commands at the UNIX prompt: 
    
    chown -R root:root bin lib commonchmod -R 777 bin lib common 
 4. When running SPSS Statistics Server with internal authentication, a regular user can be the owner of these directories. Refer to the SPSS Statistics Server Administrator’s Guide for more information. 
 5. The Fix Pack can be installed silently using the installer.properties file that comes with the 24.0 release (on the DVD): ./<installer_name> -f installer.properties where <installer_name> is the installer .bin file that you ftp'ed to the server. 
 6. You can also execute the installer directly to launch a graphical version of the installer. (Note: You will need an X Window System to do so): ./<installer_name>
    Note for graphical installer: You should change the default installer directory for the patch in the Install Wizard to point it to the directory on the server where Statistics Server 24.0 is installed.

 IBM Using -Xgc:preferredHeapBase with -Xcompressedrefs - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 "Why does the JVM report a native out-of-memory (NOOM) when using compressed references? I am using a 64bit JVM and I clearly have plenty of memory left. How can I resolve this problem?" 

CAUSE
 

*In this note, please refer to Java Versioning: Java Version.Release.ServiceRelease.FixPack 
ex: Java 7.1.4.6 is the same as Java 7.1 SR4 FP6 is the same as Java 7 R1 SR4 FP6. 
The IBM JVM will automatically use compressed references [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/understanding/mm_compressed_references.html]when using a maximum heap size less than 25GB. This automated behavior was introduced in Java 6.1.5.0 and Java 7.0.4.0*. Compressed references (CR) decreases the size of Java objects making better use of available memory space. This better use of space results in improved JVM performance. *(Java 7.0.1.1 and later uses compressed references by default on z/OS) 

See Introducing WebSphere Compressed Reference Technology [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/webserver/appserv/was/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf] for detailed information on how Compressed References work. 

"When using compressed references, the size of the field used in the Java object for the Class Pointer and the Monitor/Lock is 32 bits instead of the 64bits that would be available in non-compressed mode. Because we are using 32 bits to store the location of these, and they are located in native (non-Java heap) memory, they must be allocated in the first 4GB of the address space - the maximum range we can address with the 32 bits." ~IBM Java Development Team 

If the Java heap itself is small (-Xmx), the JVM may allocate it in the lower 4GB of address space along with the Class Pointers and Monitors/Locks. If these Class Pointers, Monitors/Locks and Java heap (if included) cannot fit in the lower 4GB, a native out of memory (NOOM) [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-nativememory-linux/] will be thrown. 
ANSWER
Why Use Compressed References? 

Below the 4GB mark, the JVM does not have to perform any compression/decompression of the address pointer at runtime. Therefore, the best performance will be attained if the Class Pointers, Monitors/Locks and Java heap can all be contained comfortably within the lowest 4GB of the address space. 

 

Determining Address Location of Java Heap Memory 

To verify if the Java heap has memory regions below the 4GB mark, check the "Object Memory" section in the javacore:

Convert the "start" address from the hex value to a GB value [http://ss64.com/convert.html]. In the example below, 0x000000000F010000=0.23GB which is below the the 4GB (0x0000000100000000) mark.



 * [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890&amp;aid=1]


Setting the Preferred Heap Base with -Xgc:preferredHeapBase 

Starting with Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0, and later, the JVM will determine if the Java heap will fit comfortably in the lower 4GB. If it is too large, the JVM will automatically allocate the Java heap above the 4GB mark (APAR IV37797 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV37797]). 



NOTE: In IBM System z platforms (i.e. z/OS and z/Linux), automatic shift of the heap above the 4GB address space does NOT occur because on these platforms, there is an additional performance penalty 
associated with higher shift values. To resolve Native OOM issues due to a shortage of heap memory in the lower region on z platforms, use -Xnocompressedrefs (see below). 
See related: IBM Knowledge Center - JVMJ9GC089W [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_7.0.0/com.ibm.java.messages/diag/appendixes/messages/j9gc/message_jvmj9gc089.html] However, in earlier Java 6.1 and Java 7.0 versions (earlier than Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0), if the Java heap can not fit in the lower 4GB, a NOOM will occur. To avoid this problem, the generic JVM argument [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21417365] -Xgc:preferredHeapBase=<address> [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/understanding/mm_compressed_references.html] can be used to ensure the Java heap is allocated above the 4GB address space. This will leave more room for the Class Pointer and Monitor/Lock memory. 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * This will locate the Java heap starting at the 4GB mark thus leaving the lower 4GB for the other processes.


Increase Maximum Heap Size to Force Heap Allocation Above the 4GB mark 

Another way to ensure that the heap is allocated above the 4GB mark (Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0 and later) is to set a maximum heap size equal to or greater than 4GB. For example -Xmx4G will ensure that the heap will have to be allocated above the 4GB mark. This will not work in earlier versions of the JVM since these earlier versions allowed the heap to straddle the 4GB mark, placing part of the memory above and some below (fixed as part of APAR IV37797) . 

 

Further Investigation 

If after setting -Xgc:preferredHeapBase=<address> or -Xmx4G a NOOM is still encountered (Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0 and later), then further investigation is required at the application level. Look to decrease the size and usage of the applications Class Pointers and Monitors/Locks. Additionally, there are some WebSphere Application Server troubleshooting methods that may help reduce the native memory footprint. See: IBM Troubleshooting native memory issues [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg21373312].

Reserving Low-Memory Space with -Xmcrs

If there is still free memory in the system when a Native OutOfMemory (NOOM) occurs, then the problem may be a shortage of memory in the low-memory region (under 4GB). Even if the Java heap is located above this boundary, other data associated with Java objects can be located in the low-memory region.

The OS memory allocator will deal out low-memory freely, thus memory resources in the lower boundary may run out. Later when the JVM tries to allocate memory for an artifact which is required to be allocated in low-memory (because the JVM has only reserved a 32bit pointer for it) it fails and throws an OutOfMemoryError.

Starting in Java 6.0.16.3, Java 6.1.8.3, Java 7.0.8.10, Java 7.1.2.10, there is a parameter -Xmcrs [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_6.0.0/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/appendixes/cmdline/xmcrs.html] which allows the JVM to increase the amount of low memory it reserves on startup. With this setting, as long as the low-memory usage by the JVM does not exceed the -Xmcrs value, NOOM in the lower boundary will be avoided.

To set this parameter, first decide what a reasonable value for your lower memory requirements may be. Reasonable value is unique to each environment so there is not a general recommendation.

 * 


Disabling Compressed References with -Xnocompressedrefs As a last resort, if the native memory still can not be contained under the 4GB mark, you can set -Xnocompressedrefs [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/appendixes/cmdline/Xnocompressedrefs.html] as a generic JVM argument. [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21417365] Using -Xnocompressedrefs will remove the use of compressed references and therefore remove the lower 4GB memory restriction on the Class Pointers and Monitors/Locks. This will however, result in a significant increase in Java heap memory requirements. It is not uncommon for 70% more heap space to be required. Due to the increased memory requirements it is strongly advised that the Java heap size is adjusted to a larger value and garbage collection is monitored and retuned as required.

Additionally, some benchmarks show a 10-20% relative throughput decrease when disabling compressed references: "Analysis shows that a 64-bit application without CR yields only 80-85% of 32-bit throughput but with CR yields 90-95%. Depending on application requirements, CR can improve performance up to 20% over standard 64-bit." See:ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/webserver/appserv/was/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/webserver/appserv/was/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf].

Before using -Xnocompressedrefs as a solution, first rule out the possibility of a native memory leak. Since using -Xnocompressedrefs will allow the the native memory to grow unbounded, a leak in native memory will lead to process size growth eventually leading to a process that needs to be paged out. The paging will incur performance overhead which will eventually lead to an unstable environment. Therefore careful consideration must be used when selecting -Xnocompressedrefs as a solution.


Memory Map Considerations 

The below figure is a generalization of how the JVM handles addresses in each section of the memory map based on heap size and compressed references (CR). Please note that at each stage beyond having all of the Java memory contained below the 4GB mark, there will be performance consequences: 



[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890&amp;aid=3] 

No Compressed References Overhead using -Xnocompressedrefs 
or
-Xmx > 25GB -increased memory footprint
-fewer/larger objects stored on heap leads to more frequent GC
-lower cache and translation look aside buffer (TLB) utilization [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890&amp;aid=4] Compressed References Overhead maximum heap address used by the Java JVM process is below 4GB none maximum heap address used by the Java JVM process is above 4GB but below 32GB compression/decompression of address pointers 


Getting Assistance From IBM Support 
If further assistance will be required from IBM WebSphere Support, please set the following -Xdump [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/tools/dumpagents_syntax.html] parameters in the generic JVM arguments [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21417365]: 
 * 
 * 
 * 


Then restart the JVM and recreate the problem. Once the NOOM is encountered, process the resulting system core with jextract [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21577379]. Send the jextracted core file, heapdump, javacore, snap trace, systemOut.log, native_stderr.log, native_stdout.log and systemErr.log to IBM Support [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21153852] for further analysis.

 IBM Configuring defaultRowPrefetch for an Oracle JDBC driver - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The setting defaultRowPrefetch is used to help increase the performance of queries to Oracle databases and we sometimes find customers who want to enable this feature for Oracle database connections to increase the prefetched rows. 

Oracle JDBC drivers have a feature built in as an extension that allows you to set the number of rows that are prefetched while the full result set is being formulated. This is to reduce the number of trips back and forth to the database. 


SYMPTOM
If defaultRowPrefetch is set as a custom property on the datasource, this will not work as the defaultRowPrefetch is not a datasource property but a property on the connection itself .


CAUSE
defaultRowPrefetch is a property of the connection and not of the datasource

ENVIRONMENT
WebSphere Application Server using an Oracle JDBC driver

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Customer sets this property and does not see it work. This may result in longer times to getting the full result set and more round trips to the database.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The Oracle defaultRowPrefetch can be set in an attempt to speed up queries to a database that return multiple rows. But, it cannot be set as a custom property in a datasource. Please see below:

The way to set this connection property is as follows:. 




You cannot set defaultRowPrefetch as a JVM property. It would have to be named 
oracle.jdbc.defaultRowPrefetch for that to work. You can only use this property

 IBM What are the supported Apple Macintosh Operating System Versions for IBM SPSS Statistics? - United States SPSS mac macintosh Apple Macintosh statistics OS supported version compatibility matrix leopard Snow Leopard Lion Mountain Lion 10.8 Mavericks 10.9 22 Yosemite 10.10 (Yosemite) el capitan 10.11 spss 24 Sierra 10.12 High Sierra 10.13 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I would like to know what are the supported Macintosh Operating system versions for IBM SPSS Statistics versions? 

ANSWER
Please see the list below. It is strongly recommended to review the platform information on IBM Software Product Compatibility Reports [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/prodguid/v1r0/clarity/index.jsp]. The installation of IBM SPSS Statistics software on Apple Macintosh OSX operating systems requires an Intel processor. 

A) Apple Macintosh MacOS High Sierra (10.13) 

Support for IBM SPSS Statistics 25 only. Please note that no other SPSS release will be officially supported on High Sierra, but older versions like SPSS Statistics 24 may run as well on High Sierra. 

NOTE: There's a known issue with some of the earlier release of Mac High Sierra system (13.0 and 13.1 beta version). 
The top menu of SPSS 25 may disappear if the Mac OS system is set to Non-English. 
The official MacOSX 10.13.1 version do not have this issue. So, if you encountert this issue you need to update your Mac OS version to latest official 10.13.1 build from Apple. 

 

B) Apple Macintosh MacOS Sierra (10.12) 

Support for IBM SPSS Statistics 25 and IBM SPSS Statistics 24 only. For release 24 It is also recommended to install the latest FixPack 2 for release 24 on Mac [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24043574]. [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24042675] 

No older SPSS Statistics releases are supported on Sierra. 

 

C) Apple Macintosh OSX El Capitan (10.11) 

Support for IBM SPSS Statistics 24. Please see the Release notes - IBM SPSS Statistics 24.0 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27047057] for known issues on Macintosh. 

Full documentation including installation material provided in different languages and manuals for release 24 can be found on IBM SPSS Statistics 24 Documentation [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27047033] webpage. 

 

Also, Support for IBM SPSS Statistics 23. Note: if you want to install on El Capitan, please refer to technote 1970391 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21970391] 

 

D) Apple Macintosh OSX Yosemite (10.10) 

Support for IBM SPSS Statistics 24, IBM SPSS Statistics 23 and IBM SPSS Statistics 22 

 

Note: Mac OSX 10.10 (Yosemite) was released on Thursday, October 16th 2014 by Apple after Statistics 22 was released. If you like to use Statistics 22 on Yosemite you need to install Statistics 22 Fixpack 2 as well. Statistics 22 FixPack 2 and release Statistics 23 are fully tested on Yosemite OSX 10.10. So if you like to run Statistics 22 on Yosemite please install Statistics 22 FixPack 2 and also read the section below: 

**** 

In some instances it can be necessary to re-install the legacy Apple Java 6 on 10.10 for the use of Statistics 22 FixPack 2 on this platform

Download and re-install Apple Java 6 

- After you upgraded your Apple Mac OSX from a previous release to 10.10, Apple Java 6 may no longer exists on your upgraded system. If you then launch Statistics 22 which is an application that relies on Java 6, it can happen, the Mac OS pops up a dialog box stating Java 6 was requested, but none is present.
- The Java dialog has a "More Info" button, which when clicked opens a browser to an Apple Tech Support page for Apple Java 2014-001. A download link is provided:
http://support.apple.com/kb/dl1572 [http://support.apple.com/kb/dl1572]
- Click on the download link and a DMG containing the Java 6 installer is downloaded.
- Then you open the Java DMG, double click on the Java installer, follow the prompts and complete the installation of Java 6.

******* 

 

E) Apple Macintosh OSC Mavericks (10.9) 

Support for IBM SPSS Statistics 23 and IBM SPSS Statistics 22 

*** 

Note: IBM SPSS Statistics 22 was developed and released prior to Apple's release of OS X 10.9 (Mavericks). However, Statistics 22 can be installed on Mac OSX 10.9 if you install Apple Java SE 6 (1.6.0_65) on OS X 10.9 first before you install Statistics 22. Please see http://support.apple.com/kb/dl1572 [http://support.apple.com/kb/dl1572] for download.

 IBM DataType incorrect on Secondary - United States netcool; impact; netcool/impact; nci; data; type; datatype; .type; replication; cluster; sync; error; 500; mark; invalid TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The DataType is not being correctly replicated across the ImpactServer Cluster 

SYMPTOM
The .type file of the Secondary ImpactServer configuration is truncated with the error message: 

 * 
 * 


CAUSE
APAR "IZ81446: IMPACT 511 CLUSTER UNABLE TO REPLICATE DATATYPES WITH USERPARMETERS VALUES IN EXCESS OF 16,000 CHARACTERS." [link below] 





RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Additional comments associated with APAR IZ81446 release notes: 


"a new property is added to increase the file size limit:



 * 


Add the property to $NCHOME/impact/etc/<SERVERNAME>_server.props file 
where size limit can be 8192, 16384, 32768, etc.. " 

The property would have to be added to all ImpactServers in the Cluster and would require a restart to enable - ensuring that the ImpactServer started as Primary had the correct, uncorrupted .type file to be replicated across the Cluster. Also ensure that there are no trailing white-space characters on the property as these invalidate properties in lower versions of Impact. 

The APAR is not an issue in Impact 6 and 7, but one would still have to include this property with an appropriate value to handle a large character length for the USERPARAMETERS parameter. 

The character length includes the whole USERPARAMETERS property name as well as the definition. 

For example one would add the property: 

 * 


to the files: 

 * 
 * 
 * 


where one wished to allow the replication of a DataType between two ImpactServers called NCI1 and NCI2 in a Cluster where the USERPARMETERS property line were 20,000 characters long.

 IBM Can an update query be run against the C&DS repository to update job results? - United States mass change query update results TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 We have jobs set up in SPSS Deployment Manager. We would like to do a mass change of the location set up on the location set on the location tab. 

CAUSE
Currently all results are written to a specific file system and the server is full. We would like to change the location the results of the output. 

ANSWER
The job data is stored as metadata. There is no query or batch process that can be run to do a mass update to change the location of your results tab. The recommendation is to work with your IT administrator to clean up your file system, point your file system to a new location or manually update all of your jobs

 IBM How do I change the default 'fit content by' behaviour of Daeja viewer in IBM Content Navigator, to fit content by height or width? - United States fit by height; fit by width; fit; default fit; Daeja viewer; FileNet viewer; Daeja; scale TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I change the default 'fit content by' behaviour of Daeja viewer in IBM Content Navigator, to fit content by height or width? 

ANSWER
In Content Navigator v2.0.2 

In the ..navigator.war/applets/filenetViewer_properties.jsp file, set the value of the parameter 'scale' as follows 

To fit content by width, specify - scale: "ftow",
To fit content by height, specify - scale: "ftoh",

Here's another way to modify the behaviour: 

 * make the same changes above to the filenetViewer_properties.jsp under ECMClient\configure\explodedformat\navigator\applets folder. 
 * Rebuild and redeploy the ear file. 
 * Restart the application server


Save the changes and they should get picked up when the viewer is re-launched.  

In Content Navigator v2.0.3 

The same parameter-value pair mentioned above can be added in the Additional Settings section of the Daeja ViewONE panel, of the admin desktop. Add the parameter-value pair to the Additional Settings section of 

 * the Professional tab for modifying the behaviour of the Daeja Professional viewer 
 * the Virtual tab for modifying the behaviour of the Daeja Virtual viewer.


Click New in the Additional Settings section to add the parameter-value pair. Save the changes and they should get picked up when the viewer is re-launched. 

 IBM Data Server Manager (DSM) showing SQLCODE=-206 "<name> is not valid in the context where it is used." - United States SQLCODE 206 -206 SQL0206 SQL0206N DSM incompatible db2level fixpack fix pack db2iupdt TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Data Server Manager log files are full of SQLCODE=-206 "<name> is not valid in the context where it
is used." error 

SYMPTOM
The symptoms can vary depending on each installation. 

Most common scenario, DSM shows Data Pending status for the monitored database.


CAUSE
When you apply a new DB2 fixpack, the db2iupdt command is used to update an instance to a higher level within a release. 

But that command does not necessarily update the database system catalog to support the new fix pack that you have installed.
Meaning, just because the db2level shows a higher level, your database can still be using routines from an older DB2 level. 



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
One way to verify what routine levels your database is using, you can run the following DB2 command on the monitored database: 

db2 "select versionnumber from sysibm.sysversions order by 1 desc" 

If the results is showing a lower level than the ones DSM supports, that means your environment
is not supported, and you are getting the SQLCODE=-206 error.

To verify what are the DB2 levels supported by DSM, please refer to the links below:
- System requirements for IBM Data Server Manager, version 1.1.2 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27045176]
- System requirements for IBM Data Server Manager, version 2.1 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27048115]



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Run the db2updvnn command according to the db2level of your monitored database: 

- For DB2 V9.7 run db2updv97 [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEPGG_9.7.0/com.ibm.db2.luw.admin.cmd.doc/doc/r0054449.html] command
- For DB2 V10.1 run db2updv10 [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEPGG_11.1.0/com.ibm.db2.luw.admin.cmd.doc/doc/r0054449.html] command
- For DB2 V10.5 run db2updv105 [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEPGG_11.1.0/com.ibm.db2.luw.admin.cmd.doc/doc/r0054449.html] command

CAUSE

The Admin user exists on Base Portal but not the Realm which is configured to Virtual Portal.

The Administrator User who is listed as the Domain Admin retrieved with:
com.presence.connect.wmmcomms.UserManagementServiceImpl.getPortalAdministrator() does not have access to the Virtual Portal.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

The Admin user has to be made visible on both base and virtual Portals if you wish to syndicate between the two.

When syndicating to Virtual Portals, the Administrator User who is listed as the Domain Admin retrieved with:
com.presence.connect.wmmcomms.UserManagementServiceImpl.getPortalAdministrator() should have access to the Virtual Portal.

 IBM IAM9:  Message Broker – WebSphere Decision Service Node - United States iam9; JRules; Decision Management; Rule Engine; ILog DOWNLOADABLE FILES

ABSTRACT
 This SupportPac provides a node to execute the J2SE rule execution server (RES) of WebSphere Operational Decision Management inside the WebSphere Message Broker JVM. 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
This SupportPac provides a WebSphere Decision Service Node in WebSphere Message Broker to run a J2SE runtime business rules engine that can process rules based on the business content from messages within message broker flows. The runtime rules engine can come from the WebSphere Operational Decision Management (WODM). The node receives a input message, extracts the rule set parameter and then runs the rule engine. The result is sent to the output terminal and can be used for complex routing and decision making. 

The SupportPac makes existing custom integrations between WebSphere Message Broker and WebSphere Operational Decision Management simpler to implement.

The SupportPac is delivered as a User Defined Node added to the Message Broker Toolkit palette. 
• WebSphere Message Broker v7, v8, v9 with IAM9 node v1 SupportPac with ODM v7, v7.5 and v8.
• WebSphere Message Broker v7, v8, v9 with IAM9 node v2 SupportPac with ODM V8.0.1 and 8.5.

Possible Uses
Decision Service node can be used for:
• Complex flow decisions by rule.
• Content based routing by rule.

New in this Release
• Provide a node implementation for all ODM releases currently available.
• Change the user interface and input to look similar to the decision service node of IBM Integration Bus (formerly known as WebSphere Message Broker) v9.
• Enable Decision Warehouse.
• Provide Local Environment Structure to set rule set path and rule set parameters.

 IBM Solving IBM MQ Java code version mismatches using the mqjavalist.sh script - United States WebSphere MQ WMQ TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When Java™ SE applications and Java EE application servers such as WebSphere Application Server do not use a consistent set of MQ Java archives, applications can fail in unpredictable ways. If WebSphere Application Server notices a mismatch, it issues this message: "MQJCA1008 The WebSphere MQ classes for JMS were found in the class path but were not the correct version. This error can occur if the application server finds an earlier version of the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS in the class path. The error can also occur if you do not configure WebSphere Application Server to use the correct version of the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS." 

ENVIRONMENT
The mqjavalist.sh script runs on Linux and UNIX systems and can identify Java archives and classes from MQ V5.3 and later versions. Although the mqjavalist.sh script does not run on Windows systems, it is possible to zip up a directory structure on Windows in order to examine it with mqjavalist.sh on a different system. To use the mqjavalist.sh script, download it from the bottom of this page, copy it to the target system, and make the script executable. Make sure that either the unzip command or the Java jar command is available in your PATH before running mqjavalist.sh. For example:



 1. Preparing to run mqjavalist.sh
 2. 
 3.  sh> chmod +x mqjavalist.sh 
    sh> PATH=$PATH:/opt/java7/bin 
    




DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
IBM MQ ships a number of Java archives (jar files) that applications use to connect to MQ and work with messages. For Java EE environments, MQ provides a Resource Adapter called wmq.jmsra.rar which contains the jar files required by JMS applications. Java SE and Java EE applications must use a consistent set of MQ jar files at the same maintenance level, or else they might experience a wide variety of problems including intermittent errors, performance problems, and other failures.

It is common to find multiple versions of the MQ jar files in the Java CLASSPATH, or invalidly bundled in Java applications (.ear, .war, and .jar files). Finding and eliminating duplicate copies of the MQ jar files can be a difficult task, but the mqjavalist.sh script simplifies that task on Linux and UNIX systems.

EXAMPLES

 1. Search for MQ files under /usr/IBM/WebSphere and save the results to the file mqlist.txt:
    
    mqjavalist.sh -f mqlist.txt -d /usr/IBM/WebSphere
 2. 
 3. 
 4. Perform a recursive search of archives under /opt/IBM:
    
    mqjavalist.sh -r -d /opt/IBM
 5. 
 6. 
 7. Recursively search archive files under the /opt/IBM/IIB and /opt/mqm directories and enable verbose output to ~/output.txt:
    
    mqjavalist.sh -vrf ~/output.txt -d /opt/IBM/IIB -d /opt/mqm

WEBSPHERE APPLICATION SERVER

WebSphere Application Server and other IBM products built on WebSphere Application Server normally show the MQ jar files in more than one location. Except as noted below, the copies of the MQ jar files should match the versions listed on this page [https://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21248089]. Any copies of the MQ jar files other than those listed below might represent a problem: 


 1. WebSphere Application Server V8.5.5, V8.5 and V8.0
 2. 
 3. 



 1. WebSphere Application Server V7.0
 2. 
 3. 
 4. 
 5. 
 6. If you created a WebSphere Application Server V7.0 profile before applying fix pack 7.0.0.1 or later, you must update the profile to use the correct MQ Resource Adapter path [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_7.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/info/ae/ae/tmj_wmqra_restoredefault.html]. Otherwise, the application servers in that profile will use the old MQ Resource Adapter jars under the profile installedConnectors/wmq.jmsra.rar directory rather than the MQ jars in the main installedConnectors/wmq.jmsra.rar directory, which are kept up to date by WebSphere Application Server fix packs.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM

Review the output from mqjavalist.sh to determine where copies of the MQ jar files have been found. Not all duplicates represent a problem, unless they are being loaded by your Java SE application or Java EE application server at runtime. If the com.ibm.mq.commonservices.jar file shows an implementation version of ${version.number} - ${build.level} just ignore it.

In the sample output above, entries #16 through #27 represent the jar files for the installed MQ Resource Adapter. They all show an implementation version of 7.1.0.0 - k000-L111005.1 except for #21, com.ibm.mqjms.jar, which shows an implementation version of 7.0.1.5 - k701-105-110419. Because the jar file versions are not in sync, MQ JMS will not function as expected.

In cases like this, the wmq.jmsra.rar file should contain a copy of the MQ jar at the right level for the application server. Entry #14 in the mqjavalist.sh output shows the com.ibm.mqjms.jar file with an implementation version of 7.1.0.0 - k000-L111005.1, which is what we need. Use the jar program to extract the com.ibm.mqjms.jar file from the wmq.jmsra.rar archive, then copy it over the back-level version of the jar. Use chown and chmod to ensure the permissions on the file are correct.

In other cases, you might find that the classpath for the application server, or for your Java SE application, is picking up extra copies of the MQ jar files. Eliminating unnecessary classpath entries can resolve the problem.

If your Java EE application (.ear or .war) bundles a copy of any MQ jar files, you should remove them and rely on the ones from the installed MQ Resource Adapter instead.

 IBM Demystifying the WebSphere StaleConnectionException - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 What is the StaleConnectionException, why is it issued by WebSphere Application Server, and what should be done about it? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In WebSphere Application Server, the StaleConnectionException is issued when the database vendor issues an exception indicating that a connection currently in the connection pool is no longer valid. This can happen for many reasons, including: 

 * The application tries to get a connection and fails, as when the database is not started.
   
   
 * A connection is no longer usable due to a database failure. When an application tries to use a connection it has previously obtained, the connection is no longer valid. In this case, all connections currently in use by an application can get this error when they try to use the connection.
   
   
 * The application using the connection has already called close() and then tries to use the connection again.
   
   
 * The application tries to use a JDBC™ resource, such as a statement, obtained on a now-stale connection.


When the StaleConnectionException is issued, the behavior is determined by the Purge Policy setting for the connection pool. If the Purge Policy is set to EntirePool, the entire pool is flushed. But if the Purge Policy is set to FailingConnectionOnly, only the connection that caused the StaleConnectionException is purged from the pool. 

An application can recover from bad connections by explicitly catching the StaleConnectionException and getting a new connection from the pool. Numerous exceptions issued by DB2, Oracle, DataDirect (for connecting to SQLServer), Sybase, and Informix are currently mapped to the StaleConnectionException, which makes recovery easier for the application programmer. The following pseudocode provides an example of how to recover from a StaleConnectionException: 

//get a userTransaction
javax.transaction.UserTransaction tran = getSessionContext().getUserTransaction();
//retry indicates whether to retry or not
//numOfRetries states how many retries have
// been attempted
boolean retry = false;
int numOfRetries = 0;
java.sql.Connection conn = null;
java.sql.Statement stmt = null;
do {
try {
//begin a transaction
tran.begin();
//Assumes that a datasource has already been obtained
//from JNDI
conn = ds.getConnection();
conn.setAutoCommit(false);
stmt = conn.createStatement();
stmt.execute("INSERT INTO EMPLOYEES VALUES
(0101, 'Bill', 'R', 'Smith')");
tran.commit();
retry = false;
} catch(java.sql.SQLException sqlX)
{
// If the error indicates the connection is stale, then
// rollback and retry the action
if (com.ibm.websphere.rsadapter.WSCallHelper
.getDataStoreHelper(ds)
.isConnectionError(sqlX))
{
try {
tran.rollback();
} catch (java.lang.Exception e) {
//deal with exception
//in most cases, this can be ignored
}
if (numOfRetries < 2) {
retry = true;
numOfRetries++;
} else {
retry = false;
}
}
else
{
//deal with other database exception
retry = false
}
} finally {
//always cleanup JDBC resources
try {
if(stmt != null) stmt.close();
} catch (java.sql.SQLException sqle) {
//usually can ignore
}
try {
if(conn != null) conn.close();
} catch (java.sql.SQLException sqle) {
//usually can ignore
}
}
} while (retry) ;

 IBM Prerequisites for IBM Content Collector Version 4.0.1 - United States  PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION

ABSTRACT
 This document details the system requirements for IBM Content Collector Version 4.0.1. 

CONTENT
 

Always up-to-date system requirement reports can be dynamically generated by using the Software Product Compatibility Reports (SPCR) tool [http://www-969.ibm.com/software/reports/compatibility/clarity/index.html]. 

From the Content Collector product tabs below you can select detailed system requirement reports for different contexts (by Operating System, by component). Note that clicking a link will always generate a new, up-to-date report.

Important:
Because other products frequently ship fixes, updates, and new releases, testing every configuration is not possible. In general, you can install and run with updates to supported products if those updates are forward compatible.

Always check for the latest IBM Content Collector security bulletins in the IBM Support Portal and make sure to have the required fixes applied.

 IBM Error when launching Scan task from Datacap Desktop. - United States Desktop; No data; Scan; VScan TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Receiving the following error message when attempting to launch up Scan task from Datacap Desktop:
"This batch has no data to process. Aborting." 

Then followed by this error: 
"Unable to run queue." 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The panel for TravelDocs contained a value with all upper-case letter [eg. TRAVELDOCS], which caused the error to occur when attempting to launch the Scan task from Datacap Desktop

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The "Bind DCO type to panel" for Datacap Desktop is case-sensitive. Be sure the DCO name matches as it appears in Datacap Studio (both the spelling and case-sensitivity). 

Logon to TMWeb client. 

Go to Administrator tab 

Select the VScan task from the Workflow. 

Click Setup under Program. 

Then change the value of the Panel to match what is in Datacap Studio. For example "TRAVELDOCS" to "TravelDocs"

IS THE WEBSPHERE MQ V7.0 RESOURCE ADAPTER SUPPORTED IN WEBSPHERE APPLICATION SERVER?

 * Yes, the WebSphere MQ V7.0 Resource Adapter [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21248089#7dotx_0] shipped with WebSphere Application Server V8.0 and V7.0 is supported through 30 April 2018 [https://www.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?subtype=ca&infotype=an&appname=iSource&supplier=897&letternum=ENUS916-143], when both of those versions of WebSphere Application Server end support, or longer if you purchase a WebSphere Application Server support extension.
   
 * Similarly, the WebSphere MQ V7.1 Resource Adapter [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21248089#7dotx_0_0] shipped with WebSphere Application Server V8.5.x is supported as long as that version of WebSphere Application Server remains in support, or longer if you purchase a WebSphere Application Server support extension.
   
 * However, if you manually install your own copy of the WebSphere MQ V7.x Resource Adapter in WebSphere Application Server or any third-party Java EE server, it will go out of support with the corresponding WebSphere MQ server version.
   
 * The IBM MQ V8.0 and V9.0 Resource Adapters cannot be installed in WebSphere Application Server V8.5.x, V8.0 and V7.0 because those versions support JMS 1.1 while the IBM MQ Resource Adapters implement JMS 2.0. WebSphere Application Server V9.0 ships with the IBM MQ V9.0 Resource Adapter [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21248089#7dotx_0_0_0] and includes full support for JMS 2.0. The version of MQ Resource Adapter you use must be supported by your Java EE server but does not need to match the version of the queue managers to which you wish to connect.

 IBM Unable to log on to FileNet WorkplaceXT receive an AE SecurityCheckFilter error - United States AE SecurityCheckFilter; JSSE; unlimited strength TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Unable to log on to FileNet WorkplaceXT - AE SecurityCheckFilter error 

SYMPTOM
When attempting to log on to FileNet WorkplaceXT deployed on an IBM WebSphere Application Server, the following error is displayed : 

Exception Message: [Filter AE SecurityCheckFilter]: filter is unavailable. 
Filter AE SecurityCheckFilter: filter is unavailable. 


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
SystemOut.log may contain the following exception : 


Problem initializing encryption/decryption with keyId abcd1234, size 256 bits. java.home=<<WAS_home>>\AppServer\java\jre. Cause: java.security.InvalidKeyException: Illegal key size or default parameters

at com.filenet.ae.toolkit.server.servlet.filter.SecurityCheckFilter.doFilter(SecurityCheckFilter.java:51)
....



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This behavior occurs if Workplace XT is configured to use Maximum strength keys (>128bit) during installation. In this case, the JRE used by the J2EE Application server, for example <<WAS_home>>\AppServer\java\jre should contain unlimited strength policy files, otherwise it will be unable to encrypt / decrypt user tokens. 

 

 * One option is to install the JSSE unlimited strength jar files for the JRE used by the J2EE Application Server. For IBM JREs, more info can be found at 
   
   https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/security/ [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/security/] 
   
   
 * Another option is to regenerate the encryption keys using 128bit encryption which doesn't require the unlimited strength policy .jar files. Please refer to the P8 Infocenter for usage information on the com.filenet.wcm.api.util.MakeCryptoKeys utility. 

 IBM Component parameters missing for Enable Hold and Virtual Interview Multiple Response functionality - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

 IBM Raise the feature level of a single VOB without increasing the feature level for other VOBs on the server - United States feature level; chflevel; unreplicated; non-replicated; base; clearcase; 1150579; feature levels; replicated VOB TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How can you increase the feature level of a single non-replicated IBM Rational ClearCase VOB without increasing the feature level for the other VOBs on the server? 

ANSWER
 

Execute the following two commands: 

 1. cleartool chflevel -replica <new feature level> replica:<replica name>@\<vob tag>
    
    
 2. cleartool chflevel -family <new feature level> vob:\<vob tag>



Notes:  * These commands are used for replicated VOB as well; however, there are special considerations that need to be taken when changing the feature level of a VOB that is replicated. Review the MultiSite Administrator's Guide under the topic of Feature levels [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cchelp/v7r0m1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.rational.clearcase.cc_ms_admin.doc/c_feature_levels.htm]for more details.
   
 * If a VOB is used in a UCM environment, the PVOB and all Component VOBs must be at the same feature level in order to utilize the features of that level.


Example: 

 1. Open a command prompt and set into a view
    
    
 2. Mount and change directory into the VOB tag
    
    
 3. Describe the VOB to show current feature level
    
    > cleartool describe -long vob:.
    versioned object base "/vobstore/test_vob"

 4. Determine the replica name (by default is original)
    
    > cleartool lsreplica
    For VOB replica "/vobstore/test_vob":
    23-Mar.09:36 jdoe replica "original"
    
    
 5. Change the feature level.  * Step 1:
       > cleartool chflevel -replica 3 replica:original@/vobstore/test_vob
       Replica feature level raised to 3.
       
       
     * Step 2:
       > cleartool chflevel -family 3 vob:/vobstore/test_vob
       cleartool: Warning: Raising the VOB family feature level may make it impossible to move this VOB to servers running an earlier revision of ClearCase and to create MultiSite replicas of this VOB on such servers.
       Raise VOB family feature level? [no] y
       VOB family feature level raised to 3.
       
       
    
    
 6. Describe the VOB to show new feature level:
    
    > cleartool describe -long vob:.
    versioned object base "/vobstore/test_vob"

 IBM HTTP Session time-out settings and overwrite precedence rules - United States WebSphere http session management time-out wasrun precedence overwrite TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 It is possible to set the HTTP Session time-out in various places on the IBM® WebSphere® Application Server Administrative Console. It is also possible to set HTTP Session time-out for the application packaging process. 

Since Session time-out can be set in multiple places, it is necessary to understand how the ultimate Session time-out for an application is determined. 

CAUSE
Application needs HTTP session time-out set.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The HTTP Session time-out can be set in the following places: 

 * From the Administrative Console at the server, Enterprise application, and Web application levels 
 * At the time when the application is packaged 
 * In the application code


Setting the HTTP Session time-out from the Administrative Console 
1. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the server level, navigate to Servers > Application Servers > Your Server > Web Container > Session Management. 

In the Session time-out section of this window, you can select No time-out or Set time-out by clicking the appropriate radio button. If you choose to set the time-out, type the desired value in minutes in the box. 


2. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the Enterprise Application level, navigate to Applications > Enterprise Applications > Your Application > Session Management. 

Check Override in the Override Session Management section, then select to set the time-out and the time-out value. This sets the application session to overwrite those values set at the parent, which in this case is the Server level. 


3. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the Web Application level, navigate to Applications > Enterprise Applications > Your Application > Web Module > Your Web App.war > Session Management. 

Check Override in the Override Session Management section, then select to set the time-out and the time-out value. This sets the Application Session to overwrite those values set at the parent levels, which in this case is the Server or Enterprise Application level. 

After modifying these settings, save the master configuration. 

Setting HTTP Session time-out when application is packaged 

The application developer can also select to set the HTTP Session time-out parameter when the application is packaged. This value is stored in the web.xml file for the Web application. 

This setting overrides any session time-outs defined from the Administrative Console. Alter this setting by repackaging the application with a new value, or by modifying the web.xml file. The entry in the web.xml will be as follows: 
          <session-config> 
      *          <session-timeout>60</session-timeout>
 * 
 *       </session-config>

 

Where the "session-timeout" is an integer value for the desired session time-out in minutes. 
Setting HTTP Session time-out from the application code 

Finally, the HTTP Session time-out can be set in the application code. The programmer can invoke the setMaxInactiveInterval() method on HttpSession object to set the time-out value as desired. This setting overrides any time-out defined in the application package or made from the Administrative Console. 

HTTP Session time-out Override Precedence Summary 

The list below shows the precedence from which the final HTTP Session time-out is derived. 

1. Server Level [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21163875&amp;aid=1] Lowest level 2. Enterprise Application [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21163875&amp;aid=1] Overrides the Server Level if Override is selected 3. Web Application [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21163875&amp;aid=1] Overrides the Server and Enterprise Application settings if Override is selected 4. Application Level (web.xml) [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21163875&amp;aid=1] Overrides Server, Enterprise Application, and Web Application settings 5. Application Code [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21163875&amp;aid=1] Overrides all other settings RELATED INFORMATION

 IBM Increasing Java Heap Memory in IBM Tivoli Common Reporting 2.1/2.1.1 - United States TCR - Tivoli Common Reporting TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How to increase Java heap memory size in IBM Tivoli Common Reporting (TCR) 2.1/2.1.1 versions? 

CAUSE
Running a large scale report with Default java heap settings might result in OutOfMemory error

ANSWER
TCR 2.1/2.1.1 server provides a default setting for heap size, a minimum size (xms) of 512MB and a maximum size (xmx) of 1024MB. 

In order to change the heap memory size, execute the following command:
<INST>/tipv2/bin/wsadmin.sh[.bat] -user <USERNAME> -password <PASSWORD> -f <INST>/tipv2/profiles/TIPProfile/bin/changeMem.py --xms <MINVALUE> --xmx <MAXVALUE>

where <INST> is the TCR Installation folder like /opt/IBM/tivoli
<MINVALUE> can be 1024 and <MAXVALUE> can be 1843 (1GB and 1.8GB respectively)

NOTE: In order to avoid OutOfMemory error, it is recommended to be within the 2GB limit (for 32 bit architectures - maximum memory can be 2^32)
For 64-bit JVM, the maximum heap value can be upto 50% of the available physical memory. Reason being maximum memory will be 2^64 which is 16 exabytes which is a very huge number! 
1 exabyte = 1024*1024*1024 Gigabyte!
Please refer to the links provided in the 'Related Infomation' section to learn more on the Java sizing and heap information.

To test the JVM's maximum heap memory support, please follow the below test:
a) Open command line / shell script and navigate to <INST>/tipv2/java/jre/bin folder
b) Execute this command: java -Xmx1843m hello
- if java accepts this 1.8GB setting, then it will throw the "class not found" error for hello
- if java does not accept this value, then it gives the "Initialization error" and "Failed to instantiate heap" message!
- You can try to increase the value of Xmx and see where it breaks
- For 32-bit JVM, it is not advised to set this value beyond 1843m but for 64-bit JVM, value can be upto 50% of the available physical memory.

After setting the new values, restart the TCR server for the changes to take effect.

 IBM Upgrading to Jazz for Service Management Version 1.1.3.0 using Installation Manager results in a permission denied error - United States jazzsm1130relnotes TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When upgrading Jazz for Service Management to Version 1.1.3.0 using Installation Manager, the installation fails with the following error:

Cannot run program "/space/IBM/JazzSM/ui/bin/wrapper.sh" (in directory "/space/IBM/JazzSM/ui/bin"): error=13, Permission denied [/space/IBM/JazzSM/install/tip/tipWrapp
erInstall.xml:215] 

CAUSE
During the upgrade process the non-root user does not have the correct permissions to run the shell script. This is due to the following:
1. Jazz for Service Management is installed as a non-root user
2. Installation Manager is installed in user mode through root user


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The upgrade must be initiated by using the attached script, which gives the non-root user (who originally installed this Jazz for Service Management instance) the correct permissions for the upgrade process. 


The script takes two mandatory arguments and one optional argument.

Usage: ./JazzSMgrpModeUpgrade.sh "IM_Install_Location" 
"JazzSM_Install_Location [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEKCU_1.1.3.0/com.ibm.psc.doc/ref/psc_r_pathnames.html]""[Response_file_with_absolute_Path]"

For example (showing default installation paths): ./JazzSMgrpModeUpgrade.sh "/home/root/IBM/InstallManager/" "/opt/IBM/JazzSM/" "/opt/Download/dash_upgrade_rsp.xml"


For IM GUI mode installation, provide the 2 mandatory arguments; IM_Install_Location and JazzSM_Install_Location. 
This argument combination invokes Installation Manager in GUI mode and lead you through the rest of the upgrade process.

For IM Silent installation, provide all 3 arguments; IM_Install_Location , JazzSM_Install_Location, and Response_file_with_absolute_Path.
This argument combination invokes Installation Manager in silent mode to upgrade JazzSM.

 IBM Trouble installing ITM on Windows OS - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Getting the below error when you try to install ITM on Window OS 

"D:\Program Files\IBM\ITM" includes blanks. Due to your system settings the installation path cannot include blanks, please specify location with no spaces. 

SYMPTOM
When you try to install ITM on " C:\Program Files\IBM\ITM" it woks fine but when we try to install it on "D:\Program Files\IBM\ITM" we get the below error:


"D:\Program Files\IBM\ITM" includes blanks. Due to your system settings the installation path cannot include blanks, please specify location with no spaces.

If you take out the spaces and use D:\ProgramFiles\IBM\ITM, the install will continue. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

Couple of ways to fix this... 

 

1. Remove the space in the directory path and install the ITM on a directory without spaces. 

Example : D:\IBM\ITM 

 

2. Check the NTFS 8.3 name creation and enable the 8.3 naming creation to install the ITM on a directory path with spaces.

check the value on the below registry location 


HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem\NtfsDisable8dot3NameCreation

In case NtfsDisable8dot3NameCreation is set to (2), this means the following: NTFS sets the 8.3 naming convention creation on a per volume basis.

You can check the 8.3 name creation using this command for the volumes that are impacted.

For example, if the %TEMP% folder is located on c:\, but you are installing on d:\, then you should run these commands: 


fsutil 8dot3name query c:
fsutil 8dot3name query d:

You will get an output like this:
The volume state is: 0 (8dot3 name creation is enabled).
The registry state is: 2 (Per volume setting - the default). 


Value and Meaning

0 NTFS creates short file names. This setting enables applications that cannot process long file names and computers that use different code pages to find the files.
1 NTFS does not create short file names. Although this setting increases file performance, applications that cannot process long file names, and computers that use different code pages, might not be able to find the files.
2 NTFS sets the 8.3 naming convention creation on a per volume basis.
3 NTFS disables 8dot3 name creation on all volumes except the system volume.

 IBM Differences between Rational Rhapsody 8.0 Statecharts and UML 2.4.1 Behavior State Machine - United States Restriction; Restrictions; Limitation; Limitations; drawing; graphical; graph; difference; diferences; gap; deffer; feature; features; concept; concepts; error; errors WHITE PAPER

ABSTRACT
 This is a white paper that explains the differences between IBM Rational Rhapsody 8.0.x Statecharts and UML 2.4.1 Behavior State Machine. 

CONTENT
 

Authors: Shinji Kanai, Moria Abadi


OMG UML and IBM Rational Rhapsody have been evolving in parallel, and some differences were created and expanded over time. Not all graphical notations that are defined in UML specification are supported by Rhapsody. There are certain patterns of transitions you cannot draw due to restrictions imposed deliberately, but not necessarily limited by UML specification. Some of UML features such as deferred event and do-activity are not natively supported today. This document covers such gaps that are found between UML specification and Rhapsody implementation, aiming to help you design statechart more effectively and enable easier interchange of statecharts among UML-based modeling tools.




Disclaimer This documentation is created based on differences that are found between Rhapsody 8.0.x Statechart and OMG UML 2.4.1 Superstructure Specification (UML spec). The content is believed to be accurate at the time of publication. Use this documentation at your own risk as it might contain some incompleteness and imprecision.

there is a risk that is involved to support an execution of an action that is being performed while the owning object is in a certain state. For example, there is a state "WaitForInput" with Do Action reading an input from the console in the background. Now an event comes to trigger a transition - a need arose to interrupt the operation of reading the input - but there is no generic way to do such things for all operations unless the action is being performed in a different thread and kill this thread. this solution seems risky for embedded systems and considered inefficient.

 IBM Transformation Extender Oracle adapter does not support SYS_REFCURSOR return type in an Oracle stored procedure / function - United States Oracle Adapter Unsupported datatype SYS_REFCURSOR TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When using the IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender (WTX) / IBM Transformation Extender (ITX) Oracle adapter to call a stored procedure / function with a REF_SYSCURSOR return type, a failure of "Unsupported datatype returned is being treated as text" occurs. 

SYMPTOM
The Oracle database adapter log (.dbl) reports the following error:

Unsupported datatype returned is being treated as text.


CAUSE
SYS_REFCURSOR is not a valid datatype as a return from an Oracle stored procedure call using the WTX / ITX Oracle adapter.

ENVIRONMENT
IBM WebSphere TX / IBM TX Oracle adapter on any valid execution platform

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
LASTERRORMSG() reports 'Failed to execute the SQL statement' and the database adapter log reports 'Unsupported datatype returned is being treated as text.'

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Redesign the Stored Procedure to NOT return a SYS_REFCURSOR datatype. 

 IBM SCM check analyses are showing as <not activated> the SCA user interface - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The reason why your check analyses are no longer showing activated and returning data in the SCA user interface. 

SYMPTOM
Check analyses in the SCA interface are showing as <not activated> in the SCA user interface where at one point they were activated and returning data. Now they are not activated and not returning data.


CAUSE
The operator who activated the analysis has been deleted. The audit trail cleaner tool was run and it removed the operator and de-activated the analysis.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the issue, have an active operator reactivate the check analyses and then run a new import in SCA. As a best practice, it is recommended that you have an operator account dedicated to activating the SCM check analyses in your deployment. This account should never be deleted.

 IBM How to serve static files from both IBM HTTP Server and an application in WebSphere Application Server - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How can I configure IBM HTTP Server (IHS), and the IBM web server Plug-in, and my web application running in WebSphere Application Server (WAS), to serve some of my static files (JPG, GIF, CSS, JS, etc) from the IHS web server, but serve other static files from my web app running in WAS? 

CAUSE
The "fileServingEnabled" property in the ibm-web-ext.xmi file in the web application, is like an ON / OFF switch.
A setting of fileServingEnabled="true" means that ALL static files will be served from the web application in WAS only. In this case, the plug-in config will use a wildcard with the application context-root like "/myapp/*". That way every URL starting with /myapp/* will be routed to the application in WAS.

On the other hand, fileServingEnabled="false" means NO static files will be served from the application in WAS. In this case, a wildcard will NOT be used in the plugin-cfg.xml file. Instead, there will be several URI entries matching the URL-Patterns from <servlet-mappings> in the web.xml, like "/myapp/servlet1" and "/myapp/index.jsp". Requests for dynamic content matching the URI entries in the Plug-in config, will be routed to the application in WAS. But everything else (static content) will be handled by the IHS web server itself.


ANSWER
If you want to serve any static files (JPG, GIF, CSS, JS, etc) from your web application in WAS, you must use fileServingEnabled="true" in the ibm-web-ext.xmi file. That will cause the plug-in to use a wildcard entry for the context-root of your web application. For example, if the context-root is "myapp", then there will be a URI entry for "/myapp/*" in the plug-in config, and everything starting with "myapp" will be routed to the application in WAS. 


Now, if you also want to be able to serve some of the static files from the IHS web server itself, you will need to do a trick using RewriteRule in the IHS config. Here is how the trick works:

1) Create a subdirectory called "static" under the IHS DocumentRoot directory. And put the static files that you want IHS to serve into that directory. For example in the IHS document root directory (HTTPServer/htdocs/) create a subdirectory called "static". Something like this:
/usr/IBM/HTTPServer/htdocs/static/

2) In your web application, you will reference those files using relative references like "static/picture.jpg", or "static/mystyles.css".

Those relative references will be interpreted as URLs like this:
/myapp/static/picture.jpg
/myapp/static/mystyles.css

Keep in mind that there really is NOT any "static" subdirectory in the application. But that is ok.

3) Now, in the IHS config, you must use RewriteCond and RewriteRule to watch for these references, and redirect to get them from IHS. For example, look at these directives...

<ifModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule ^/myapp/static/(.*) /static/$1 [PT]
</ifModule>

It means, if the URI begins with /myapp/static/* then IHS will rewrite it to just /static/* and "pass-through". Since /static/* does NOT match anything in the Plug-in config, the request will be handled by IHS, and the file will be served from the static directory under IHS DocumentRoot.

To the user looking at the URL in the browser they will see this:
/hostname/myapp/static/picture.jpg

But, the file will really be served by IHS from here:
/hostname/static/picture.jpg

Here is another example:

If you just want to match and serve *.gif files from IHS, use:

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} \.(gif)$ [NC]
RewriteRule ^/myapp/(.*) /static/$1 [PT]

If you just want to match and serve *.gif, *.css and *.js files from IHS, use:

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} \.(gif|css|js)$ [NC]
RewriteRule ^/myapp/(.*) /static/$1 [PT]

Which assumes the files themselves are placed in [IHS_DOC_ROOT]/static/.

4) For the static files in the application, you will need to put them in some other directory that is NOT called "static", for example "images/sunset.jpg" would be a directory and file in the myapp application. This URL request, would be handled by the Plug-in and sent to the application in WAS:
hostname/myapp/images/sunset.jpg


So, by using the trick described above, some static files will be served from IHS, like:
/hostname/myapp/static/picture.jpg

But other static files will be served from the web application running in WAS, like:
/hostname/myapp/images/sunset.jpg

 IBM How to get debug information when the IBM Content Navigator Installer on the Unix Platform is failling? - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How to get debug information when the IBM Content Navigator Installer on the Unix Platform is failling?


ANSWER
To capture the debug output from the UNIX command line, enter one of the following (based on what shell you are using) at the command line prior to executing the installer:
export LAX_DEBUG=true or setenv LAX_DEBUG true or LAX_DEBUG=true or set LAX_DEBUG or whatever would be appropriate for the Unix shell. 

Then run the installer. The output that is produced should help debug the installer. 
If you would like to redirect output to a file:
1. Set LAX_DEBUG=file as per the instruction above. 
2. Run your installer. 
3. Once the install is complete a file labeled jx.log will be generated in the same directory as your installer. This file will contain the entire debug output generated by the install.

 IBM Why does IBM Datacap 8.1 appear to hang, requiring a restart of all components? - United States hang; non responsive; timeout; Admin retry; Engine retry TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Why does IBM Datacap appear to hang, requiring a restart of all components? 

SYMPTOM
The Datacap system appears to become non-responsive, requiring a restart of all components to get it working again.


CAUSE
The cause is due to a malformed SQL query string. From the client perspective, it was reported to occur during logon via TMWeb, and Thick Client. Another case was from a user that was doing a Thick Client query. 

TMServer has an feature where it will retry any command that results in error, based on the settings in the registry. The settings reflect the number of retries to do and the time interval to wait. The default settings have a duration of 16 minutes, which gives the appearance that the TMServer has hung.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Collect and examine the TMServer log. Look for multiple instances (6-12) of an ADO error, indicating a bad query was executed. This information can be used to identify the user that is causing the problem



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
While bad queries should be avoided, the following will allow TMServer to respond faster, should a bad query happen: 

1. Stop all Datacap applications, then stop the TMServer. 

2. Change the following registry entries on the TMServer box:


 * 
 * 
 *  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Datacap\TMS\InterThread (REG_SZ) Admin retries HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Datacap\TMS\InterThread (REG_SZ) ADO retries HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Datacap\TMS\InterThread (REG_SZ) Engine retries 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Datacap\TMS\InterThread (REG_SZ) Admin retries HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Datacap\TMS\InterThread (REG_SZ) ADO retries HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Datacap\TMS\InterThread (REG_SZ) Engine retries 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


3. Restart the TMServer, then start the Datacap applications in reverse order. 

Please Note: Since these are considered tuning parameters, you will need to test to see what settings work best for your system. 

Note: for Datacap 9.x, the registry entry name is singular, as in 'Admin retry' or 'Engine retry'.

 IBM Changes in the default user identifier between WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 classes for JMS and WebSphere MQ V7.1 classes for JMS - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 You have configured a WebSphere Application Server WebSphere MQ messaging provider connection factory without an Authentication Alias and do not programmatically supply user identifier information when creating a connection to a queue manager. You notice a change in the default behaviour between WebSphere Application Server versions regarding the user identifier flowed on the MQCONN to the target WebSphere MQ Queue Manager:

- When using WebSphere Application Server v7.0 and v8.0, no user identifier value (blank) is passed to the queue manager. 

- When using WebSphere Application Server V8.5, a non-blank user identifier value is passed to the queue manager. 

In the latter case, you receive the following exception when creating a connection to a queue manager:

JMSCMQ0001: WebSphere MQ call failed with compcode '2' ('MQCC_FAILED') reason '2035' ('MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED') 

Is this change in behaviour expected? 

ANSWER
WebSphere MQ access control is based on user identifiers. There is a deliberate change in the default behaviour between the WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 classes for JMS and the WebSphere MQ V7.1 (and later) classes for JMS regarding the default user identifier flowed to the queue manager.
From the WebSphere MQ V7.1 classes for JMS onwards, a non-blank user identifier is always flowed to the queue manager when creating a connection to WebSphere MQ. This is true even if no user identifier has been specified, or a blank or null user identifier has been specified; for example by calling:

MQConnectionFactory.createConnection();

or:

MQConnectionFactory.createConnection(“”, “”);

or:

MQConnectionFactory.createConnection(null, null);

In the case where a null or blank user identifier has been specified, the WebSphere MQ V7.1 and later classes for JMS will query the value of the Java System Property user.name. The value of this property is flowed to the queue manager for authorization.

As a result, if the user identifier specified by the Java System Property user.name is not authorized to access the queue manager, the queue manager will return an exception to the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS with Reason Code MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED and the connection to the queue manager will not be established.

This change in behaviour could affect topologies that previously relied on the default behaviour in the WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 classes for JMS that flowed a blank user identifier when establishing a CLIENT mode transport connection. The expectation that a blank or null user identifier will be flowed by default, and that the user identifier that started the WebSphere MQ server-connection channel would be used by the queue manager when performing the authorization checks, is no longer valid from the WebSphere MQ V7.1 classes for JMS.

In the case outlined above, system administrators that are currently relying on the default behaviour of the WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 classes for JMS should review their configurations regarding the use of user identifiers and authorization. This might also help to improve security within their WebSphere MQ topology.


In summary, the change in behaviour will affect users of:

- The WebSphere MQ V7.1 and later classes for JMS.

- The WebSphere MQ V7.1 and later JCA Resource Adapter that includes the classes for JMS.

- Versions of WebSphere Application Server that include the WebSphere MQ V7.1 and later JCA Resource Adapter. Currently this is WebSphere Application Server V8.5.0.0 and later.


The com.ibm.mq.jms.ForceUserID Java System Property

A Java System Property called “com.ibm.mq.jms.ForceUserID” was introduced as part of APAR IZ49302 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IZ49302] and included from WebSphere MQ V6.0.2.8 and WebSphere MQ V7.0.1.

The changes made as part of this APAR could be used to change the default behaviour in the WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 classes for JMS regarding the user identifier value flowed to the queue manager when creating a connection.

This property is no longer valid from WebSphere MQ V7.1. Setting this property will have no affect on the WebSphere MQ V7.1 classes for JMS and later.

 IBM Configure IBM Content Collector to use SSL to communicate with IBM FileNet P8. - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I configure IBM Content Collector (ICC) to use SSL to communicate with IBM FileNet P8 for all components? 

CAUSE
ICC communicates with P8 in several different components. Depending on the API used for the various components, P8 certificates need to be installed in multiple places.

ANSWER
Do the following steps to install P8 certificates. Depending on your business requirements, you may not use all of the components so some steps may not be necessary. 

 * First obtain a P8 server certificate by accessing the P8 Content Engine ping page using this URL: https://<ce_server>:<ssl_port>/FileNet/Engine 
   
   From the browser, view the certificate and copy it to a file. Use it for later steps. 
   Do not use the MTOM page as it may not produce the same certificate that ICC requires. 
   
    
   
   
 * Perform this step if you are going to run ICC Initial Configuration to create new document classes in P8 object store.  * To import the certificate, issue the following command, whereICCInstallDiris the directory of your Content Collector installation andP8CertificatFileis the certificate for the FileNet P8 server: "ICCInstallDir\java\jre\bin\keytool.exe" -import -file P8CertificateFile
      -keystore "ICCInstallDir\java\jre\lib\security\cacerts" -alias afup8 
      
      
    * At the password prompt, enter the password for the JRE keystore. (The default password is changeit.) 
    * Enterywhen asked whether to trust the certificate. 
    * Run ICC Initial Configuration and you should then be able to validate the connection with P8 using SSL.
   
   

 * Perform this step if you are going to run task route archiving to P8:  * Add the P8 certificate into the Windows Trusted Root Certificate Authorities via the Microsoft Management Console. 
    * For more details instructions, refer to this document:
      http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21610358 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21610358]
   
   

 * Perform this step if you are going to retrieve, restore, or search for documents from P8:  * Start ikeyman from ICC-install-directory\AFUWeb\ewasfor the ICC embedded web application server. 
    * In the ikeyman utility, select Key Database File>Open, and select PKCS12as key database type. 
    * In theLocationfield, specify theWAShome\profiles\profile name\config\cells\cell name\nodes\node name\trust.p12file.
      ReplaceWAShome,profile name,cell name, andnode namewith the proper values of your web application server installation. 
    * Click OK. 
    * When prompted for a password, enter the password. ClickOK. The default password is WebAS. 
    * Under theSigner certificateslist, clickAddto add the P8 certificate. 
    * Exit ikeyman utility and restart IBM Content Collector Web Application service.

 IBM Using dblook and ij to work with the embedded Apache Derby in WebSphere Portal - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM WebSphere Portal 6.1 uses an embedded version of Apache Derby out of the box. However, there is no longer a graphical tool such as CloudView (as with Cloudscape 5.x). In order to obtain the data and structure of the WebSphere Portal database, dblook and ij utilities can be used to accomplish such goals. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM

Before proceeding with the following, it is strongly recommended that you back up your Derby database. Make a copy of <wp_profile>/PortalServer/derby/wpsdb to a backup directory. Since the version of Derby used in WebSphere Portal is embedded, you must stop the Portal server before you can access the database although you can always work on the backup copy.

NOTE: For simplicity, we will omit the extension of the utilities. You should add ".sh" or ".bat' depending on the platform.

There are three primary utility tools that are installed with WebSphere 6.1, "dblook", "ij", and "sysinfo", under the <was_root>/AppServer/derby/bin/embedded directory. The sysinfo utility generates information about the operating system, the Java version and classpath, and the Derby driver files and version information.

dblook utility
The dblook utility is used to view the database structure (in DDL - Data Definition Language) for a specific database. 

The usage is dblook -d <databaseURL> [options], where databaseURL is in the "jdbc:derby:<database>" format. The <database> should be given as a full path, such as C:\IBM\WebSphere\wp_profile\derby\wpsdb. 

Commonly used options include: 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Examples:
 * 
 * 
 * dblook -d jdbc:derby:C:\IBM\WebSphere\wp_profile\PortalServer\wpsdb -o C:\temp\wpsdb_ddl.sql
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * dblook -d jdbc:derby:C:\IBM\WebSphere\wp_profile\PortalServer\wpsdb -z release -o C:\temp\wpsdb_ddl.sql
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * dblook -d jdbc:derby:C:\IBM\WebSphere\wp_profile\PortalServer\wpsdb -z release -t user_desc -verbose -o C:\temp\user_desc.sql
 * 
 * 


ij utility 
The ij utility is a command line SQL processor. It can be used to run DDL for creating database, tables, indexes, and so on. In a WebSphere Portal environment, it would typically be used for exporting data or making simple changes (when advised by IBM Support). 

To start ij, simply open a command prompt or terminal window, change the directory and enter the command. You should then see the ij shell with prompt "ij>". 

The following are some common commands that you may use when reviewing data in the Portal database.  * 
 * ij> connect 'jdbc:derby:C:\IBM\WebSphere\wp_profile\derby\wpsdb';
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * ij> show connections;
 * 
 * 
 *  CONNECTION0* - jdbc:derby:C:\ibm\websphere\wp_profile\portalserver\derby\wpsdb 
   * = current connection 
   ij> driver "org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver'; 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * ij> set schema=release;
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * ij> select * from user_desc where oid=1000;
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * ij> run 'myquery.sql';
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * ij> CALL SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_EXPORT_TABLE('RELEASE','USER_DESC','USER_DESC.SQL',';','|',NULL);
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * ij> 
 * CALL SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_EXPORT_QUERY('SELECT * FROM RELEASE.USER_DESC','user_desc_query.sqlL',null,'|',NULL);
 * 
 *

 IBM Exceptions starting WAS 8.5 as non root user on Solaris - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You notice the exceptions below at start up. 

SYMPTOM
Exception: command /usr/sbin/zonecfg failed with 1
and 
FFDC Exception:java.lang.Exception SourceId:com.ibm.ws.xd.vv.nodedetect.NetworkInterfaceUtil.getMacAddresses ProbeId:2
java.lang.Exception: dlopen() returned error; rc=128


CAUSE
When WebSphere Application Server is run as a non-root user it will not be able to run native commands. This limited access causes the exceptions.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the problem, run WebSphere Application Server under a root user. If the environment is not virtualized, that is if Solaris zones are not being used then the errors can be ignored as these will only occur at start up and will not affect a non-virtualized environment 

 IBM How to set an appropriate number of Portal Datasource connections in WebSphere Portal - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
For a given maximum number of Portal WebContainer threads set, what should I set my maximum Portal datasource connections to? 

ANSWER
When tuning WebSphere Portal at version 6.0 and beyond, one of the concerns that arises is how should one tune the maximum number of Portal datasources. Portal can and does make heavy internal use of datasources, so miscalculating this (maximum) value can have a significant impact on system behavior. Out of the box, the default maximum setting is 50. This may or may not be sufficient for any given system. 

Each Portal request may make any number of database (DB) requests ranging for none to several.. Further, customized portlets and PPR (Parallel Portlet Rendering) may cause several concurrent DB requests. By default, the maximum number of WebContainer threads is also set to 50. Therefore the ratio between the maximum number of Portal datasource connections to the maximum number of Portal WebContainer threads is 1:1. Support has found that this ratio is often too low for the best performance. In the past, there have been recommendations of this ratio as high as of 2:1 or even 2.5:1. 

However, these values caused concern in large deployments where the TOTAL number of maximum datasource connections might start to place a strain on backend resources. Recent analysis suggests that these ratio values may be safely reduced to 1.25: 1 for all Portal datasource, with the exception of the jcrDB when WCM is used extensively. In this case, we recommend a ratio of 1.5:1 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

For example, if your system's 

Maximum number of WebContainer threads is 100 

then you should set your 

Maximum number of Portal datasource connections to 125 

for each Portal datasource. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

If during Runtime, you should find that your running out of Portal Datasource connections, you may go ahead and increase the ratio up to 2:1. Please be aware of how this might impact your backend resources and be sure to scale your database accordingly. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

To find the number of WebContainer threads that are running in any particular Portal server, use the WebSphere Application Server Admin Console and go to the following location: 

Servers ---> Application Servers --> WebSphere_Portal (your server) --> Thread Pools --> WebContainer 

 

To find the Data Source setting for your Portal datasources, use the WebSphere Application Server Admin Console to go to the following location: 

Resources ---> Data Sources ---> wpdbDB (for example) --> Connection pools

Knowing this I further reviewed the SystemOut.log to see where the JCR
web module gets loaded during startup....it should begin like this...

Your startup does not have this. This prompted me to review the
deployment.xml from the JavaContentRepository application directory at
this location...

The contents show the following...

<targetMappings xmi:id="DeploymentTargetMapping_1335003370698"
enable="false" target="ServerTarget_1335003370698"/>

The enable=false means that you have this application set to not
autostart. Because of this it is not starting during Portal startup
and therefore is not available when the config task attempts to
communicate with it during the upgrade...and therefore causes the
problem.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Please make the following change in the WAS Admin Console...
Applications > WebSphere enterprise applications >
JavaContentRepository > Target specific application status > Check the
box for the WebSphere_Portal server > Click Enable Auto Start > Save
changes > restart Portal

After making this change please attempt the CF upgrade again.

 IBM Tivoli Integrated Portal hangs because of Argus java.lang.OutOfMemory. - United States cacheTime; config.xml; Argus; TIP cache; TIPL2CONF; TIPL2PERF TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Argus stores it's role authorizations in memory cache, and is not cleaned out unless the TIP is restarted. The "cacheTime" variable controls this, which is set to -1 by default. If the number of TIP roles is high, it can cause Java OOM errors. 

SYMPTOM
TIP hangs. SystemOut.log file shows Java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: 

[10/2/13 9:27:54:838 CDT] 0000002a webapp E com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.webapp.WebApp logServletError SRVE0293E: 
[Servlet Error]-[/secure/isclite/tiles/nop.jsp]: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space at java.lang.Object.clone(Native Method)


CAUSE
By default, the ARGUS cache will not get cleaned up unless the TIP server is restarted. This normally will give the system good runtime performance. However, in cases where a large number of user/role mappings are defined, the system may run into Java memory issues causing Java OutOfMemory outages.

The cacheTime we are talking about here is Argus cache. The is used for the way the role authorizations are stored in memory by Argus and nothing related to LDAP or SSO. The Argus cache time by default we ship with in TIP is -1 which means the cache will not get cleaned up till we re-start the server. 

Error from the <TIP_HOME>/profiles/TIPProfile/logs/server1/SystemOut.log

[Servlet Error]-[/secure/isclite/tiles/nop.jsp]: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space at java.lang.Object.clone(Native Method)


ENVIRONMENT
all environments



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Java heapdump files will be created in the <TIP_HOME>/profiles/TIPProfile directory. 

heapdump.20131022.144244.20034001.phd 

The Systemout.log will have have errors similar to this: 


[10/2/13 9:27:54:838 CDT] 0000002a webapp E com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.webapp.WebApp logServletError SRVE0293E: 
[Servlet Error]-[/secure/isclite/tiles/nop.jsp]: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space at java.lang.Object.clone(Native Method) 


Using the memory heap dump analysis shows that Argus is the problem, specifically the instance shown inside the red line in the output of the Java memory analyzer below: 

 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21657452&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21657452&aid=1]

You can also check the cacheTime variable in the <TIP_HOME>/profiles/TIPProfile/config/cells/TIPCell/commonauthz/config.xml file to confirm if it's set to "-1", which means the Argus cache will not get cleaned up unless the TIP server is restarted.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The cacheTime value in config.xml is in milliseconds. TIP is shipped with the initial value of -1, which means the Argus cache will not be cleared out unless TIP restart. To resolve this issue you need to configure 'cacheTime' to non -1 value. Initially we suggest setting the value to 1200000, which is 20 minutes. After the change you will have to restart the TIP server, normally server1. 

NOTE: The cacheTime variable was added in TIP version 2.2.0.0.

 IBM Multiple logins using the same user ID - United States ConcurrentModificationException; log in; login; multiple; userid; multiple login TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 "ConcurrentModificationException" and other errors may occur if the same user id is logged in to IBM WebSphere Portal multiple times.


ANSWER
WebSphere Portal has no built-in mechanism or configuration setting to limit the number of times a user id may log in. Unexpected behavior may occur if the same id is logged in more than once and this is not supported. 

"ConcurrentModificationException" and other errors may be logged.

Most of the related issues were resolved in WebSphere Portal 5.1. However, you may still encounter exceptions or side-effects if you access the Portal in multiple browser windows using the same user id, whether or not the authentication requests take place on separate physical hosts.

It may be possible to prevent multiple logins by writing custom "tracking code." Contact IBM Services for assistance to undertake such a project. WebSphere Portal Development does not have any sample code.

If you wish to write your own code, some of the issues to be aware of are (this is not an inclusive list):

-- Multiple logins may take place on different nodes in a cluster. This means some cluster-wide mechanism would have to be in place to keep track of the logged-in users. Look at the WebSphere Application Server DistributedMap interface.

-- There should be a fail-safe way to track user logout (explicit logout and session timeout). Using a session listener might be a possibility. 

-- If a user closes the browser without logging out, that user must wait for a session timeout before logging in again. Otherwise, there should be a "force simultaneous login" option in the login user interface.

For load testing, use unique user ids or virtual users.

3. Start the WebSphere_Portal server. 

 IBM Seed value used during the instance creation is lost : Recovery procedure - United States seed lost; idsgendirksf; Encryption Seed Value; key stash file TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

THIS DOCUMENT APPLIES ONLY TO THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGE VERSION(S):
 English 

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Generating key stash file if the seed value which was used at the time of instance creation has been lost then there is no way to recover this seed value. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

There is NO way to recover the seed value used during the instance creation if it has been lost. The only workaround is to create a new instance with a new encryption seed value and then use the db2ldif and ldif2db utilities to export and import data respectively. These utilities can be supplied with the new encryption seed and the salt value of the new instance. Thus the data would be preserved(alongwith the passwords) on this new instance.

Here are the steps to follow:

1. Set up a new instance says "newinst".

$> idsicrt -I newinst -e thisismyencryptionseed -l (/home/newinst) -n

$> idscfgdb -I newinst -w ldap -a newinst -t newinst -l (/home/newinst) -n

$> idscfgsuf -s "o=ibm,c=us" -I newinst -n

$> idsdnpw -u cn=root -p root -I newinst -n

2. Note the encryption seed - "thisismyencryptionseed". Let us call this new_encryptionseed

3. Once this new instance is setup note down the salt value generated by the new server instance by searching for "cn=crypto,cn=localhost".

$> ldapsearch -D <administrator DN> -w <administrator password> -b "cn=crypto,cn=localhost" -s base objectclass=* ibm-slapdCryptoSalt

Let us call this value: new_saltvalue

4. Lets assume that the instance name with the forgotten encryption seed is "oldinst"

5. Use the db2ldif utility on the instance with the forgotten encryptionseed, oldinst with the following options -

$> db2ldif -o outputfile -I oldinst -k new_encryptionseed -t new_saltvalue

6. Once this step is successfully completed the entire data from "oldinst" would be dumped in outputfile.

7. Use the utilities like ldif2db to re-load all the data into the new server instance.







HISTORICAL NUMBER 

 IBM Procedure to change the username and/or password for the FileNet Content Engine  Directory Service Account, including the bootstrap user - United States change; user; password; fem; directory service; bootstrapconfig; bootstrap user TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do you change the user and/or password for Directory Service Account used by the Content Engine? 

ANSWER
The Directory Service user account and password are normally used in two product components: FileNet Enterprise Manager (FEM), and the application server. A coordinated update procedure should be followed when there is a need to change the user account and/or password. This procedure applies to FileNet Content Engine 4.x and above. 

 * 
 * Note: 
 * 
 * 


If the same user account is also used as the CE Bootstrap user, the corresponding user in the BootstrapConfig.properties needs to change as well. For changing the GCD admin user/password in BootstrapConfig.properties specifically, refer to this documentation: 
http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/p8docs/v4r5m1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.p8.doc/admin/security/sec_how_change_bootstrap_pwd.htm [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/p8docs/v4r5m1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.p8.doc/admin/security/sec_how_change_bootstrap_pwd.htm] 


1. Launch FEM and the application server's administrative console. 
a. Login to FEM using the Directory Service account. 
b. Login to the application server administrative console with an administrator account. 

Important: Do not close above two applications until you have completed step 5 below. 


2. Make LDAP account changes: 
a. Change the password for an existing account on the LDAP server - Using LDAP interface, change the password for the CE Directory Service account. 
OR 
b. Create a new user account on the LDAP server for the CE Directory Service account. 


3. Add new user (if applicable), to FEM 
If the bind user is also the CE admin user, then the bind user will need to be added to all the existing objects in the P8 domain. Please read Update object store with new users and groups [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/p8docs/v4r5m1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.p8.doc/admin/security/sec_how_update_os.htm] for instructions 


4. Change Directory Configuration bind user in FEM 
Using FEM (step 1a above), go to Domain properties > Directory Configuration > Select Directory Configuration > click on the Modify button > General Tab: 
a. Modify the Directory Service User with new user's full distinguish name (DN) 
b. Click on Change password check box > change to a new password > click OK. 

At this point you will be presented a dialog box with following message: 
“These changes require the application server to be restarted. Please restart the application server to incorporate these changes” 

click OK > click OK 

Important: Do not restart the application server until you have completed step 5 below. 


5. Change the user in the application server's directory configuration 

- For Websphere, in the WebSphere Administrative Console, go to Global Security > click on Configure under User Account Repository > Modify Bind Distinguished Name (DN) > Modify Bind Password > click OK and Save changes 

- For WebLogic go to Security Realms > myrealm > Providers > ldap provider and click on "Provider Specific" tab in WebLogic Admin Console. Change "Principal" and "Credential". 

- For JBoss go to <JBoss Home>\server\<CE Server>\conf directory and edit "login-config.xml". 
Find "FileNet" application-policy and in login module change bindDN/bindCredential. 


6. Changing the CE Bootstrap user 

For CE 4.5.x and above: 
a. In the Configure Bootstrap Properties task, set the Bootstrap Operation property to Modify Existing. 
b. Confirm that the Bootstrapped EAR file property contains the path to the bootstrap file you need to edit. 
c. Change the Bootstrap user password. Use Configuration Manager's features to save and run the task. 
d. Run Configuration Manager's Deploy Application. 

For CE 4.0: 
Note: This step is needed only if the GCD user name is the same as the Directory Service account. Note that the example below is for a Windows environment. 

- For WebSphere 
a. Open command prompt window, go to folder where EAR file reside (it differs depending on CE version). For example, in CE 4.5.1, go to "<CE Home> \ tools \ configure \ profiles \ <profile> \ ear" 
b. Backup Engine-ws.ear 
c. Execute the command below: 

java –jar “c:\program files\FileNet\ContentEngine\lib\BootStrapConfig.jar” –e Engine-ws.ear --username <username> --password <password> 

d. Since the Engine-ws.ear file has been deployed in the WebSphere's installedApps path, the Bootstrap file need to be copied to the path manually. Extract the props.jar file from the ear file by utility such as Winzip, copy the props.jar file to theinstalledApps location - “<WebSphere Home>\ AppServer\ profiles \ <profile name> \ InstalledApps \<serverNodecell> \ FileNetEngine.ear \ APP-INF \ lib \" 

Note that an alternative to copying the props.jar file is to uninstall and re-install the updated ear file in WebSphere. 

- For WebLogic 
a. Open command prompt window, go to folder - "<WebLogic home> \ user_projects \ domains \ <domain> \ servers " 
b. Backup FileNetEngine.ear 
c. Execute the command below: 

java –jar “c:\program files\FileNet\ContentEngine\lib\BootStrapConfig.jar” –e Engine-wl.ear --username <username> --password <password> 

- For JBoss 
a. Open command prompt window, go to folder - "<JBoss Home> \ server \ <server> \ deploy \" 
b. Backup FileNetEngine.ear 
c. Execute the command below: 

java –jar “c:\program files\FileNet\ContentEngine\lib\BootStrapConfig.jar” –e Engine-jb.ear --username <username> --password <password> 


7. Remove cached files in the application server 
- Close FileNet Enterprise Manager (Step 1a) 
- Close Administrative Console (Step 1b) 
- Stop the application server 
- Remove the cached FileNetEngine directory in the application server. 
For example, the default windows path on Websphere 6.0 is 
"C:\program files\Websphere\AppServer\profiles\<profile name>\temp\<server node>\ 
<server>\FileNetEngine" 


8. Restart the application server, and login to FEM using the new user and password. 


9. Troubleshooting 

If CE fails to start due to mistakes in the above procedures, you may not be able to redo the change through these procedures because FEM will fail to run. 
In this case, you can do the following: 

- Back out the change made to the GCD database in step 3 by deleting the latest row in the FNGCD table. 
- Back out the change made to the application server in step 4 by redoing the procedure with the previous user. 
- Back out the change made to the BootstrapConfig.properties file's GCD user by using the backup EAR file 
- Restart the application server, and login to FEM using the previous user.

 IBM Content Navigator known issue: In a SPNEGO/Kerberos Single sign-on environment, IBM Content Navigator the Log Out option is enabled - United States  PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION

ABSTRACT
 In a SPNEGO/Kerberos single sign-on (SSO) environment, your IBM Content Navigator session shows the Log Out option as enabled when you select the drop-down menu on the user name. However, the option should be disabled. 

CONTENT
IBM Content Navigator disables the Log Out option under SSO environments. However, under some SSO environments or desktop load scenarios, such as SPNEGO/Kerberos on a WebLogic Application Server, IBM Content Navigator enables the Log Out option.




If the Log Out option is enabled but does not work correctly in your SSO environment, you can remove the Log Out option by customizing the banner user session context menu that is used by your desktop configuration. 

To remove the Log Out option: 

 1.  In the administration tool, select Menus. 
 2.  Enter "User" in the Name contains filter field. 
 3.  Select the Default banner user session context menu and click Copy. 
 4.  Enter a name for the new menu such as "Banner user session context menu - no Log Out option". 
 5.  Remove the Log Out from the Selected list. 
 6.  Save the new menu. 
 7.  Open the Desktops configuration, then open your desktop configuration. 
 8.  Select the Menus tab and scroll to the Feature Context Menus section. 
 9.  Select the new menu that you created for the Banner user session context menu menu type. 
 10. Save your desktop. 


The change to the menus takes effect when the modified desktop is reloaded.

 IBM Unable to start Ping Probe by non-root user on AIX - United States Ping probe; non root; start; permissions TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

THIS DOCUMENT APPLIES ONLY TO THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGE VERSION(S):
 English 

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Ping probe fails to start when the probe is installed and started by non-root user. 

SYMPTOM
The following error is seen in the probe's log: 

Error: E-P_P-002-038: Could not change euid: Operation not permitted
Error: E-P_P-002-017: IPv4 socket failed: specified action does not have access permission of the file
Error: E-P_P-002-037: This program can only be run by root, or it must be setuid root.


CAUSE
Ping probe needs permissions which allow it to run as root and the LIBPATH setting should be changed.


ENVIRONMENT
AIX



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To enable non-root user to start the probe, you need to change the owner to root and permissions to setuid. And AIX ignores the LIBPATH setting when program runs as setuid root, so you also need to put either a copy of the required libraries, or a symbolic link to the required libraries in one of the trusted paths like /lib or /usr/lib. 


1. Change the owner to root and permissions to setuid.
e.g
# cd $OMNIHOME/probes/aix5/
# chown root:root nco_p_ping
# chmod +s nco_p_poing

2. Put a symbolic link to the required libraries.
e.g
# cd /usr/lib

# ln -s /opt/IBM/netcool/platform/aix5/lib/libgsk*
# ln -s /opt/IBM/netcool/platform/aix5/lib/libPa_r.so
# ln -s /opt/IBM/netcool/platform/aix5/lib/libnetcool_r.so
# ln -s /opt/IBM/netcool/platform/aix5/lib/libslclient_r.so
# ln -s /opt/IBM/netcool/platform/aix5/lib/libOpl_r.so
# ln -s /opt/IBM/netcool/platform/aix5/lib/libsybct_r.so
# ln -s /opt/IBM/netcool/platform/aix5/lib/libsybcs_r.so
# ln -s /opt/IBM/netcool/platform/aix5/lib/libsybtcl_r.so
# ln -s /opt/IBM/netcool/platform/aix5/lib/libsybcomn_r.so
# ln -s /opt/IBM/netcool/platform/aix5/lib/libtre.a
# ln -s /opt/IBM/netcool/platform/aix5/lib/libsybintl_r.so
# ln -s /opt/IBM/netcool/platform/aix5/lib/libicuuc40.a
# ln -s /opt/IBM/netcool/platform/aix5/lib/libicui18n40.a
# ln -s /opt/IBM/netcool/platform/aix5/lib/libicudata40.a


Note:
The required libraries can be seen by the following command:
# dump -H $NCHOME/omnibus/platform/aix5/nco_p_ping

Note:
If there are newer modules of the required libraries, it's better to create a symbolic link to the newer module.
e.g
Run
# ln -s /opt/IBM/netcool/platform/aix5/lib/libicui18n40.1.a
rather than,
# ln -s /opt/IBM/netcool/platform/aix5/lib/libicui18n40.a

But, please note that it would be better to create the symbolic links again whenever after you apply Fix pack for OMNibus core.

 IBM SqlException with message "Caught java.io.CharConversionException." and ERRORCODE=-4220 - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When an application uses the IBM Data Server Driver for JDBC and SQLJ (also known as the JCC driver) and is connected to a database with code set UTF-8 (code page 1208), it throws an
SqlException with message including "Caught java.io.CharConversionException" and ERRORCODE=-4220 if the data in a character column that it queries contains a sequence of bytes that is not a valid UTF-8 string. 

SYMPTOM
An exception is thrown similar to this: 

 com.ibm.db2.jcc.am.SqlException: [jcc][t4][1065][12306][XXX.XXX.XXX] Caught java.io.CharConversionException. See attached Throwable for details. ERRORCODE=-4220, SQLSTATE=null
[...]
Caused by: java.nio.charset.MalformedInputException: Input length = XXX
[...]
Caused by: sun.io.MalformedInputException
at sun.io.ByteToCharUTF8.convert(ByteToCharUTF8.java:XXX)
[...]



CAUSE
The JCC driver throws the exception when data in a character column that it queries is not a valid string in the database code page.

The invalid data could have been input to the database in the following ways:


 * By running an SQL statement which writes byte values to the database. For example: INSERT INTO tab1 VALUES (X'C3')

 * By running the IMPORT or LOAD commands for files which contain character data that is not in the code page of the client machine, so the appropriate code page conversion was not done. To make sure that the the appropriate code page conversion is done when running IMPORT or LOAD, specify the code page of the input file by including the "codepage=x" file type modifier (specifying the code page in place of x).

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
You can use the HEX function to find out what are the byte values in a character column. 

For example, to find out the byte values in column COL1 in table TAB1, run: 
SELECT HEX(col1) FROM tab1


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Update the invalid data with a valid UTF-8 character string. 


Alternatively, for JCC driver versions that support it you can set the JCC configuration property db2.jcc.charsetDecoderEncoder=3 so that instead of throwing an exception the JCC driver returns the Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER (U+FFFD) in place of a sequence of bytes that is not a valid UTF-8 string. 
The JCC configuration property db2.jcc.charsetDecoderEncoder is supported in versions of the JCC driver that come with DB2 LUW 9.5 Fix Pack 8 and later (APAR IC74896), DB2 LUW 9.7 Fix Pack 5 and later (APAR IC74895), and all DB2 LUW releases from DB2 10.1 onwards.

For example, suppose you have a Java program MyApp.java that executes an SQL query of a database column that contains a sequence of bytes that is not a valid string.
When you run:
java MyApp
it throws an exception. But when you run:
java -Ddb2.jcc.charsetDecoderEncoder=3 MyApp
it returns the string with any invalid sequence of bytes replaced by the Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER. 

The Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER often appears like this

 IBM Missing Icon pulldown options in DASH main menu after 3.1.2.1 Install - United States DASHL2; Console Settings; missing.; icons; WAS 8.5.5.9; DASH 3.1.2.1; Cumulative patch 5; CP5 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After fresh install of WAS 8.5.5.9 with JazzSM 1.1.2.1/DASH 3.1.2.1, the "Console Settings" is missing entries and other expected icons are missing from the DASH main page. 

SYMPTOM
After successful installation of JazzSM 1.1.2.1/DASH 3.1.2.1 with WebSphere 8.5.5.9, some of the icons in the main DASH window are missing on the left.


CAUSE
It was recently discovered that some .jar files were not included in WebSphere 8.5.5.9, that were available in previous WebSphere releases, and are required for several functions in DASH.

ENVIRONMENT
JazzSM 1.1.2.1 / DASH 3.1.2.1 WAS 8.5.5.9

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
After you login to DASH and select "Console Settings", the displayed window, which should have several lines, is blank:


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21981870&amp;aid=1]

Also, in this case there wasn't any icons in the upper left portion of the main DASH window.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The missing jar files are included in DASH 3.1.2.1 Cumulative Patch 5, which you can download from this site: 


http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~Tivoli∏uct=ibm/Tivoli/Jazz+for+Service+Management&release=1.1&platform=All&function=all [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~Tivoli&product=ibm/Tivoli/Jazz+for+Service+Management&release=1.1&platform=All&function=all] 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21981870&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21981870&aid=2]
If you have any questions as to whether DASH 3.1.2.1 Cumulative Patch 5 has been installed, please run this command:

<JazzSM_HOME>/ui/bin/consolecli Version if patch 5 has been installed, it will have output showing the patch number shown in the red square in the screen shot:

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21981870&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21981870&aid=3]

If installing on a UNIX server, you will see several of these messages, they indicate that the jar files are not currently on the server, but the Patch install will finish successfully.

 IBM Leap Second bug in older Linux kernels may affect IBM MQ and WebSphere MQ - United States  FLASH (ALERT)

ABSTRACT
 Leap seconds are a periodic one-second adjustment of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) required to keep a system's time of day close to the mean solar time.

A leap second is scheduled for 31 December 2016 at 23h 59m 60s UTC.

In the past, the addition of leap seconds caused some systems running older Linux kernels to fail. IBM MQ and WebSphere MQ queue managers running on these systems generated repeated FDC files showing Probe Id XY348010 or XC272003 from xcsCreateThread, with error code xecP_E_NO_RESOURCE. Other FDCs are also possible. 

CONTENT
On 31 December 2016, the Network Time Protocol (NTP) daemon will schedule a leap second [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second] to occur at midnight, making the final minute of the day 61 seconds long. Prior leap second insertions, including the 30 June 2016 leap second, caused some Linux systems to exhibit unexplained high CPU usage.


IBM MQ and WebSphere MQ use the Native POSIX Thread Library (NPTL) which relies on futuxes ("fast userspace mutexes") for synchronization between threads. Futexes can exhibit high CPU spins after leap seconds on Linux kernel versions 2.6.22 through 3.5-rc7, inclusive, although some Linux distributions shipped patches for kernels in this range:

 * General information on Leap Second 2016
 * 
 * Fixes and workarounds to avoid issues caused by Leap Second 2015
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Addition of leap second causes spuriously high CPU usage and futex lockups



Contact your Linux vendor to check the status of other distributions, or check the Linux kernel version using "uname -r" and confirm that your system is older than 2.6.22 or running 3.5 or later. 

If you encounter this problem, the following workaround may resolve the high CPU usage. As root, run:

 IBM Use"isolate the resource provider" to establish data source connections using a different JDBC driver from the same database vendor - United States isolate this resource provider TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Customer has defined 3 Oracle JDBC Providers at cell, node and server
scope. Client have following configuration in websphere JDBC provider. 

In Cell Scope - C:\jdbc\ojdbc5\ojdbc5.jar 

In Node Scope - C:\jdbc\ojdbc6_g\ojdbc6_g.jar 

In Server Scope- C:\jdbc\ojdbc6\ojdbc6.jar 

In this case value of JDBC driver path in WebSphere variable is identical. Nornally, If JDBC provider configure at server level then server level driver will get load first. But in this case since all three drivers are from same vendor, So we can not control which driver is picking up. In this case 
"C:\jdbc\ojdbc6\ojdbc6.jar" should be loaded first but instated, ojdbc5.jar was load first

[13. 4. 5 12:05:15:625 KST] 00000023 CompoundClass < loadClass 

oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver 

loader=com.ibm.ws.bootstrap.ExtClassLoader@5dc95dc9 

source=file:/C:/jdbc/ojdbc5/ojdbc5.jar Exit 






SYMPTOM
Due to multiple JDBC drivers from the same vendor were configured in different scopes, the wrong driver class was loaded.


CAUSE
When multiple versions of the JDBC driver are configured in WebSphere Application Server, irrespective of the scopes, there is a possibility of a collision of the classes and we cannot predict from which version of the driver jar the class got loaded. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 In order to support the existence of multiple versions of the driver jars, the "Isolate this resource provider" configuration helps to ensure there are no conflicts. This needs to be configured on each JDBC Provider. You cannot isolate only one resource provider, all the provider configurations in different scopes will have to be configured with the "Isolate this resource provider" setting. In this scenario, the resource provider classes from different versions of the jars are not imported or accessed to verify if the isolation has indeed worked. In order to use the server-scoped resource provider the datasource using the server-scoped jdbc provider will have to be referenced from the application after isolating the resource providers and using a resource reference in the application. 


Go to the JDBC Provider and enable "isolate the resource provider". When "Isolate this resource provider" is enabled, it ensures that only the jar that was specified in the classpath will be used for all the datasources under that particular JDBC provider. 

 

Here are links to Knowledge Center articles which contain further information on the setting:

 IBM Is there a limit to the number of items that can be listed within an "in" list as part of a where clause? - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Is there a limit to the number of items that can be listed within an "in" list as part of a where clause? 

CAUSE
Every time the query optimizer finds a "(NOT) IN" statement in the query, a decision must be made:
Option A: Evaluate the condition sequentially for every member of the IN-list, or 
Option B: create a temporal virtual table from this list and use JOIN logic for evaluation. 

If the amount of members in the IN-list is smaller than the value of INLIST_THRESHOLD, then option A is used. 
If the amount of members in the IN-list is equal or bigger than the value of INLIST_THRESHOLD, then option B is used.


ENVIRONMENT
Any IBM PureData System for Analytics with any NPS Release



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The short answer is no limit.


By default we create a virtual table for any "in list" with more than 5 values.

The only limitation with large "in list" statements would be the memory needed to compile the query. If the query is too complex, you can potentially run out of memory, but that will not affect other sessions since this happens inside the postgres process assigned to that session. The parameter that is responsible for this behaviour is inlist_threshold and it is safe to increase this value to 100, but not more.

show inlist_threshold;

set inlist_threshold=<value>;

 IBM Solving IBM MQ Java code version mismatches using the mqjavalist.sh script - United States WebSphere MQ WMQ TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When Java™ SE applications and Java EE application servers such as WebSphere Application Server do not use a consistent set of MQ Java archives, applications can fail in unpredictable ways. If WebSphere Application Server notices a mismatch, it issues this message: "MQJCA1008 The WebSphere MQ classes for JMS were found in the class path but were not the correct version. This error can occur if the application server finds an earlier version of the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS in the class path. The error can also occur if you do not configure WebSphere Application Server to use the correct version of the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS." 

ENVIRONMENT
The mqjavalist.sh script runs on Linux and UNIX systems and can identify Java archives and classes from MQ V5.3 and later versions. Although the mqjavalist.sh script does not run on Windows systems, it is possible to zip up a directory structure on Windows in order to examine it with mqjavalist.sh on a different system. To use the mqjavalist.sh script, download it from the bottom of this page, copy it to the target system, and make the script executable. Make sure that either the unzip command or the Java jar command is available in your PATH before running mqjavalist.sh. For example:



 1. Preparing to run mqjavalist.sh
 2. 
 3.  sh> chmod +x mqjavalist.sh 
    sh> PATH=$PATH:/opt/java7/bin 
    




DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
IBM MQ ships a number of Java archives (jar files) that applications use to connect to MQ and work with messages. For Java EE environments, MQ provides a Resource Adapter called wmq.jmsra.rar which contains the jar files required by JMS applications. Java SE and Java EE applications must use a consistent set of MQ jar files at the same maintenance level, or else they might experience a wide variety of problems including intermittent errors, performance problems, and other failures.

It is common to find multiple versions of the MQ jar files in the Java CLASSPATH, or invalidly bundled in Java applications (.ear, .war, and .jar files). Finding and eliminating duplicate copies of the MQ jar files can be a difficult task, but the mqjavalist.sh script simplifies that task on Linux and UNIX systems.

WEBSPHERE APPLICATION SERVER

WebSphere Application Server and other IBM products built on WebSphere Application Server normally show the MQ jar files in more than one location. Except as noted below, the copies of the MQ jar files should match the versions listed on this page [https://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21248089]. Any copies of the MQ jar files other than those listed below might represent a problem: 


 1. WebSphere Application Server V8.5.5, V8.5 and V8.0
 2. 
 3. 



 1. WebSphere Application Server V7.0
 2. 
 3. 
 4. 
 5. 
 6. If you created a WebSphere Application Server V7.0 profile before applying fix pack 7.0.0.1 or later, you must update the profile to use the correct MQ Resource Adapter path [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_7.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/info/ae/ae/tmj_wmqra_restoredefault.html]. Otherwise, the application servers in that profile will use the old MQ Resource Adapter jars under the profile installedConnectors/wmq.jmsra.rar directory rather than the MQ jars in the main installedConnectors/wmq.jmsra.rar directory, which are kept up to date by WebSphere Application Server fix packs.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM

Review the output from mqjavalist.sh to determine where copies of the MQ jar files have been found. Not all duplicates represent a problem, unless they are being loaded by your Java SE application or Java EE application server at runtime. If the com.ibm.mq.commonservices.jar file shows an implementation version of ${version.number} - ${build.level} just ignore it.

In the sample output above, entries #16 through #27 represent the jar files for the installed MQ Resource Adapter. They all show an implementation version of 7.1.0.0 - k000-L111005.1 except for #21, com.ibm.mqjms.jar, which shows an implementation version of 7.0.1.5 - k701-105-110419. Because the jar file versions are not in sync, MQ JMS will not function as expected.

In cases like this, the wmq.jmsra.rar file should contain a copy of the MQ jar at the right level for the application server. Entry #14 in the mqjavalist.sh output shows the com.ibm.mqjms.jar file with an implementation version of 7.1.0.0 - k000-L111005.1, which is what we need. Use the jar program to extract the com.ibm.mqjms.jar file from the wmq.jmsra.rar archive, then copy it over the back-level version of the jar. Use chown and chmod to ensure the permissions on the file are correct.

In other cases, you might find that the classpath for the application server, or for your Java SE application, is picking up extra copies of the MQ jar files. Eliminating unnecessary classpath entries can resolve the problem.

If your Java EE application (.ear or .war) bundles a copy of any MQ jar files, you should remove them and rely on the ones from the installed MQ Resource Adapter instead.

 IBM DB2 UDB Version 8, v10.5 compliance with FIPS 140-2 standard - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Is DB2 v8, v10.5 compliant to FIPS 140-2 ?. 

ANSWER

Is DB2 v10.5 compliant with FIPS 140-2?

Q: Is DB2 vulnerable to the problem described below?

V-58165 DBMS main in the middle attack [https://www.stigviewer.com/stig/database_security_requirements_guide/2015-06-23/finding/V-58165]

"One class of man-in-the-middle, or session hijacking, attack involves the adversary guessing at valid session identifiers based on patterns in identifiers already known. The preferred technique for thwarting guesses at Session IDs is the generation of unique session identifiers using a FIPS 140-2 approved random number generator. However, it is recognized that available DBMS products do not all implement the preferred technique yet may have other protections against session hijacking. Therefore, other techniques are acceptable, provided they are demonstrated to be effective. "

A: No because DB2 does not use session ids for authentication and thus not vulnerable to the attack described above. DB2 uses encryption modules which are FIPS 140-2 certified.

DB2 v8.x compliancy to FIPS 140-2

DB2 v8.x went out of support in April 2009.

What is ICC?

ICC (IBM Crypto for C) is a set of libraries from Tivoli® for performing encryption. As of DB2® Universal Database™ (DB2 UDB) Version 8 fixpak 7 (equivalent to DB2 UDB Version 8.2), DB2 is using ICC on most platforms.

Customers who need to operate in an environment that is compliant with FIPS 140-2 federal standard should take into account the releases of ICC that are shipped by DB2 on different platforms and the compliance status of those releases with FIPS 140.2.

Following is a list of platforms on which DB2 is using ICC for encryption of data flowing between clients and servers:

DB2 V8 Fixpak 7 through DB2 Fixpak 11: 
ICC Version 1.2.2 on platforms:
AIX 32 bit
HP-UX PA-RISC 32 bit
ICC Version 1.2.1 on platforms: 
AIX 64 bit
HP-UX PA-RISC 64 bit
HP-UX IA64
Linux x86, Linux x86-64, Linux IA64
Linux for zSeries
Linux for POWER
Windows x86 and IA64
Solaris SPARC 64 bit
ICC Version 1.3.9 on platforms:
Solaris x86-64 (DB2 V8.2 GA)

DB2 V8 Fixpak 12 and later: 
ICC Version 1.4.1 on platforms 
AIX
HP-UX PA-RISC
Linux x86 and x86-64
Linux for zSeries
Linux for POWER
Windows x86 and x86-64
Solaris SPARC
ICC Version 1.3.9 on platforms 
HP-UX IA64
Linux IA64
Windows IA64

Summary of known problems encountered in ICC 1.2.1/1.2.2:
There are a number of issues with DB2 and the ICC encryption libraries at levels prior to 1.3.9. The known problems are: 


 1. Severe performance problems where processes seem to hang, or take several minutes to run. 
 2. A bug in ICC code causes it to communicate with the OpenSSL EGD (Entropy Gathering Daemon) which under certain circumstances could hang 
 3. ICC symbols have not been namespaced and DB2 can end up with symbol collisions with OpenSSL code. This can also happen when multiple versions of ICC are used within the same process.


DB2 Version 8 Fixpak 12 and later incorporates IBM Crypto for C (ICC) version 1.3.9 or 1.4.1 cryptographic module which fixes these problems. 

 

Note: The latest status of ICC conformance with FIPS 140-2 standard can be obtained by referring to http://www.ibm.com/security/standards/st_evaluations.shtml [http://www.ibm.com/security/standards/st_evaluations.shtml]

 IBM JRules or ODM module fails to access database with StaleConnectionException - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 JRules and ODM modules such as Rule Execution Server (RES) and Rule Team Server (RTS) / Decision Center (DC) may fail to access their data source with the following type of exception present in the log:

com.ibm.websphere.ce.cm.StaleConnectionException: Io exception: Connection timed out 

SYMPTOM
The problem may occur when a JRules or ODM module accesses its data source after a period of database access inactivity. For example: 

 * The first user accessing a RTS / DC server that remained idle overnight experiences a failure upon logging and the server log shows an com.ibm.websphere.ce.cm.StaleConnectionException occurred at that time. 
 * After a RES server has been processing execution requests normally for some time, an attempt to deploy a ruleset update fails and the server log shows an com.ibm.websphere.ce.cm.StaleConnectionException occurred upon an attempt to invalidate a ruleset or to retrieve its definition.


CAUSE
The underlying network connection for a data source is no longer valid although the data source itself remains considered active from the WebSphere Application Server data source connection pool management perspective. An attempt by a JRules module to try and access its data base through one such data source connection provided by the Application Server may then fail. 
The network connection of a data source may become invalid for a number of reasons, one typical example is that a firewall between the Application Server and the Database has a policy to discard network connections that remain idle for some time.


ENVIRONMENT
The exception com.ibm.websphere.ce.cm.StaleConnectionException is specific to WebSphere Application Server environments. But a similar issue can be experienced with Weblogic, see: Rule Execution Server on WebLogic unable to load ruleset after period of inactivity [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21615801]



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Configure the WebSphere Application Server data source connection pool [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/info/ae/ae/udat_conpoolset.html] so as to eliminate occurrences of StaleConnectionException : 

 * Set the Minimum connections to 0 to avoid situations where a connection is kept in the pool to meet the minimum requirement, even though it may have been idle for longer than Unused timeout 
 * Set the values for Unused timeout and Reap timeout so that the sum does not exceed any network level idle connection timeout

 IBM How Connect TDWC 9.3 to TWS Engine lower level release - United States dwc 93; connect; SSL ; TLS TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 DWC 9.3 users cannot connect to TWS Engine lower level releases (8.5.1 until 9.2) 

SYMPTOM
Unable to connect to TWS 8.5.1 ,8.6 or 9.1/9.2 from DWC 9.3. 

Check the WAS SystemOut.log for error :

SSL0080E: javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException - The client and server could not negotiate the desired level of security. Reason: Server chose SSLv3, 
but that protocol version is not enabled or not supported by the client. javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Server chose SSLv3, but that protocol version is not enabled or not supported by the client.


CAUSE
DWC 9.3 is packaged with WAS 8.5.5.4 and due to known vulnerabilities has SSLV3 disabled. However TWS 9.2 and earlier versions use SSLv3 by default and so the DWC 9.3 cannot connect


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You can solve this problem by configuring your TWS engines to use TLS instead of SSL :


Backup and edit : 

TWA_HOME/WAS/TWSProfile/config/cells/TWSNodeCell/security.xml 

Find sslProtocol and change "SSL_TLS" to "TLS" 

Find ssl.protocol and change value="SSL" to value="TLS" 

Backup and edit : 

TWA_HOME/WAS/TWSProfile/properties/ssl.client.props 

Find com.ibm.ssl.protocol=SSL and change to com.ibm.ssl.protocol=TLS 

Backup and edit : 

TWA_HOME/WAS/TWSProfile/temp/ssl.client.props 

Find com.ibm.ssl.protocol=SSL and change to com.ibm.ssl.protocol=TLS 

Stop and restart WAS. 

*Be aware that your Engines are now using TLS and so you must also reconfigure any DWC 9.2 or 9.1 installations that need to connect to those engines. You would change them to use TLS in the same way as above but also by the same changes in these copies of security.xml and ssl.client.props : 

TWA_HOME/JazzSM/profile/config/cells/JazzSMNode01Cell/security.xml 

TWA_HOME/JazzSM/profile/properties/ssl.client.props 

TWA_HOME/JazzSM/profile/temp/ssl.client.props 

Please consider that since you configure with TLS the WAS of TWS Engine also the Dynamic Agent can be impacted.

Overview 
You will find common questions in this section that may help resolve your logging problems.

1. How do I use JCL with WebSphere® Application Server?

For information on how to use JCL, see The Support Authority: Using Jakarta Commons Logging (JCL) with WebSphere Application Server [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/techjournal/0901_supauth/0901_supauth.html]

2. What are IBM recommendations regarding SLF4J and Logback? 

In general, we recommend that customers use JUL when possible/practical (as mentioned in The Support Authority: A developer's guide to WebSphere Application Server logging [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/techjournal/0802_supauth/0802_supauth.html]). JUL provides a good, ubiquitous logging infrastructure, which is suitable for most applications, and integrates with WebSphere Application Server log and trace. Using JUL directly also avoids extra log/trace API "hops" that are introduced by using other log/trace frameworks that map to JUL. The WAS logs are generated using JUL Handlers connected to the root JUL Logger.

In case you don't want to use JUL, or you have code that is already instrumented with another logging package, SLF4J or Logback can be helpful. For example, you may have code already written with Log4J. Log4J log/trace is not routed to WAS log/trace files, and Log4J loggers don't show up in the WAS tree of loggers you can control from the admin console. Further, trace spec settings you make in WAS do not control Log4J logger settings. This is where SLF4J or Logback can come in handy, as you can use them to intercept Log4J calls and forward them to the logging implementation of your choice. In order to integrate well with WAS logs/trace, we would recommend you bind your SLF4J/Logback API to map your log/trace content to JUL -- this will give you the ability to see your logs/trace in the WAS log/trace files, and enable you to have easy admin console control over all of your loggers.

3. How can I get WAS logs to go to syslog or the Windows EventLog?

There are a number of places that users have asked to be able to direct logs to in the past. Most notably, a number of customers have asked for the ability to send logs to syslog.

WebSphere Application Server sends all of its logs to java.util.logging (JUL), and customers can customize what happens to the log/trace events by way of using JUL Handlers. Once content is sent to JUL, it can be handled in a variety of flexible ways:

1) By default, we store the content in our log files, such as SystemOut.log, trace.log, or the newer log and trace repositories of the High Performance Extensible Logging framework we added in WebSphere Application Server V8.0. We also send the log content over JMX notifications, which allows for remote access.

2) If customers want to send content to places like SMTP, syslog, event log, or a few other places, they can use SLF4J to route WAS logs to Log4J, and use the corresponding Log4J Appenders. In this configuration, WAS logging routes to java.util.logging, SLF4J's Handler routes the request to Log4J, and Log4J can be configured to write log records to a syslog Appender. 

3) If users want to do something even more custom, they can write their own JUL Handlers and plug them into WebSphere Application Server. 

4. I am unable to turn on WebSphere Application Server trace. The trace state sets to *=off?

The systemOut.log shows: 



[5/26/15 14:10:44:746 EDT] 000000d9 ManagerAdmin I TRAS0018I: The trace state has changed. The new trace state is *=off. 
The problem is related to the below two JVM arguments: 

-Djava.util.logging.configureByLoggingPropertiesFile=TRUE
-Djava.util.logging.config.file=<path>/logging.properties 
Verify if the above 2 JVM arguments are configured. If yes, temporary disable it so WAS trace can be enabled. 

5. The WebSphere Application Server logging has stopped, what may have caused this? 

The user might have disabled the trace by setting trace output to none. 

Setting runtime trace output to none impacts the JVM logs. To do that, the runtime trace spec will be set to *=off, which means to turn off all log levels. If customers just want to disable the trace for debug information only, we recommend setting the runtime trace spec, accordingly, instead of setting runtime trace output to none. For example, set to *=info, which is the default. 

Verify if the commons-logging.jar and commons-logging.properties exist in the JVM classpath. If yes, suggest to remove it and put them inside the application (with parent_last setting) or put them in the isolated shared library. 

6. How can I separate my logs into separate files for each application? 

In WAS V8.5, we added the application name to log and trace records stored using HPEL (High Performance Extensible Logging). Since HPEL lets you format and filter your log content after it has been persisted to the HPEL log/trace repository, this lets you decide if you want to see your application content on its own (helpful for uncluttered debug of an application), or together with the application server log/trace content (helpful to see impact of server on applications, and vice versa). 

For example, if you had 3 applications called app1, app2, and app3, you could create app specific logs as follows: WAS_INSTALL_ROOT\bin> logViewer -includeExtensions appName=app1 > app1.log
WAS_INSTALL_ROOT\bin> logViewer -includeExtensions appName=app2 > app2.log
WAS_INSTALL_ROOT\bin> logViewer -includeExtensions appName=app3 > app3.log 
or see everything in one file as follows: 

WAS_INSTALL_ROOT\bin> logViewer > all.log 
7. How can I add my own java.util.logging.Handler to WAS? 

To create a Handler you need to extend the java.util.logging.Handler class as follows (this example also shows how to filter for only the most severe messages): 

import java.util.logging.Handler;
import java.util.logging.Level;
import java.util.logging.LogRecord;
public class MyHandler extends Handler {
public void close() {
}
public void flush() {
}
public void publish(LogRecord record) {
if (record.getLevel().intValue() >= Level.SEVERE.intValue()) {
// do something...
}
}
}
In your application you can add that Handler to the root logger as follows:
import java.util.logging.Handler;
import java.util.logging.Logger;
...
Handler myHandler = new MyHandler();
Logger logger = Logger.getLogger("");
logger.addHandler(myHandler);
... 
8. Why can't I set my own log levels using the Logger setLevel method? 

The application server can run in two modes. 

By default, the logger levels are managed, and we expect any changes to logger levels to be done only through wsadmin or through the admin console. When the trace spec update is applied, we explicitly set each logger to the level specified in the trace spec -- we do not leave any named loggers at level set to null. So, while you can change a logger's level using the setLevel method, that change only lasts until you apply your next trace spec update from wsadmin or the admin console. Basically, changes you make via logger.setLevel are temporary at best, and do not apply automatically to children since the children won't have a null level. 

Alternately, you can have the server to be configured by the JRE's logging.properties file by setting the java.util.logging.configureByLoggingPropertiesFile property. In this mode, the application server will not touch the logger levels -- you cannot update the levels through the admin console, nor through wsadmin. See Java virtual machine custom properties [http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/wsbroker/redirect?version=matt&product=was-base-dist&topic=xrun_jvm] for more information on this setting. In this mode, you can specify anything you would normally specify in your logging.properties file. Be careful not to use a console handler though, as that will lead to an infinite loop, since we take data sent to System.out, turn it into LogRecords, and send it to the root logger. 
9. How can I get java.util.logging to initialize from a jre/bin/logging.properties file in the application server? 

You can do this via system property: java.util.logging.configureByLoggingPropertiesFile=true

Note that if you do set up your server in this mode, we will not manage your logger levels via the admin console.

Note also that we will ignore any console handler entries found in the logging.properties file, since we route System.out to the root logger, which would mean that a console handler would cause an infinite recursion. 

If you do use this system property, and you want to change logger levels, you have two choices:


 * 
 * 2) Set the Logger levels programatically using the Logger.setLevel method
   

10. How can I get the full logger name from log and trace records? 

The full logger name can be handy to know for enabling trace. How you get to it depends on what log and trace mode you use: 

Basic log and trace mode: 

The basic log format (not to be confused with basic log and trace mode), which is the default format for SystemOut.log / SystemErr.log / trace.log has a truncated version of the logger name: 

[4/14/11 9:41:45:218 EDT] 00000021 QuickLogTest W hello fine 54857 
There is no way to get the full logger name from basic formatted logs. You need to switch to advanced format for your logs/trace if you want to see the full logger name. Once in advanced format, log contents appear as follows: 

[4/14/11 9:41:45:218 EDT] 00000021 W UOW= source=com.ibm.somelogger.QuickLogTest org= prod= component= thread=[WebContainer : 4]
hello fine 54857 
HPEL log and trace mode: 

You can use the HPEL LogViewer command line tool to output the log/trace content in either basic or advanced format. 

> logviewer -format basic 

....
[4/14/11 9:41:45:218 EDT] 00000021 QuickLogTest W hello fine 54857
.... 
> logviewer -format advanced 

....
[4/14/11 9:41:45:218 EDT] 00000021 W UOW= source=com.ibm.somelogger.QuickLogTest org= prod= component= thread=[WebContainer : 4]
hello fine 54857
... 
11. How can I write HPEL content to a database? 

If you want to write to a Database, any of the following options will work: 

1) Write your own log handler (that writes to a database) and plug it into JSR47. (see the Java doc for java.util.logging.Handler) 

2) Write an HPEL reading Java application to read the content from an HPEL log repository and write it to a database 

3) Write an HPEL reading Java application to read the content from an HPEL log repository and write it out in .csv format, then just use the common database commands to load the .csv content into the database. 

12. How do you tune HPEL for optimal performance in tWAS? 

In the server.xml, jvmEntries element: 
- Ensure debugMode is set to false 
- Ensure RAS JMX notifications are disabled by including -Dcom.ibm.ejs.ras.disablerasnotifications=true in genericJvmArguments 
- Ensure -Xquickstart is not in the list of genericJvmArguments 

<jvmEntries xmi:id="JavaVirtualMachine_1183122130078" verboseModeClass="false" verboseModeGarbageCollection="false" verboseModeJNI="false" runHProf="false" hprofArguments="" debugMode="false" debugArgs="-Dcom.ibm.ws.classloader.j9enabled=true -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=7777" genericJvmArguments="-Dcom.ibm.ejs.ras.disablerasnotifications=true"> 
In hpelModel.xml: 
- Ensure textLog is disabled. 

<hpelTextLog xmi:id="HPELTextLog_1" enabled="false" dataDirectory="${SERVER_LOG_ROOT}"/> 
13. How can I tell who is writing to System.err / System.out ? 

Add the following to your genericJvmArgument s : 

-Xtrace:print=mt,trigger=method{com/ibm/ejs/ras/System*.*,jstacktrace} 
14. How can I identify what code is writing to System.out.println? 

Add the following to your genericJvmArguments and restart the server to see a stack trace for each call to System.out.println: 

-Xtrace:print=mt,trigger=method{java/io/PrintStream.println,jstacktrace} 
A snippet of the stack trace for a sample application, which calls System.out.println(), with the above JVM argument set, which identifies that the Hello.printHello (Hello.java:15) writes to System.out. 

03:41:01.245*0x3277900 mt.0 > java/io/PrintStream.println(Ljava/lang/String;)V Bytecode method, This = 7fffff49f98
03:41:01.247 0x3277900 j9trc_aux.0 - jstacktrace:
03:41:01.248 0x3277900 j9trc_aux.1 - [1] java.io.PrintStream.println (PrintStream.java:829)
03:41:01.248 0x3277900 j9trc_aux.1 - [2] com.ibm.jvm.io.ConsolePrintStream.println (ConsolePrintStream.java:311)
03:41:01.250 0x3277900 j9trc_aux.1 - [3] Hello.printHello (Hello.java:15)
03:41:01.251 0x3277900 j9trc_aux.1 - [4] Hello.main (Hello.java:9)Hello World
03:41:01.253 0x3277900 mt.6 < java/io/PrintStream.println(Ljava/lang/String;)V Bytecode method 
15. How can I see who called a particular method? 

Add the following to your genericJvmArguments: 

-Xtrace:print=mt,trigger=method{java/util/logging/Logger.setLevel,jstacktrace} 
16. What are the .owner files for in the log directory? 

The server creates a .owner file for each of the log files. The file content indicates which cell/node/server is the rightful user of the similarly named log file. This is used as a sort of locking mechanism to make sure that users don't improperly configure their systems. If two or more servers are configured to use the same log directory and file name, we can detect it using the .owner file and we will print a warning in the log file. 

For more information, see Java virtual machine (JVM) log settings [http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/wsbroker/redirect?version=phil&product=was-nd-dist&topic=JVMLogs_description] 

17. How can I correlate information from thread stacks in the javacore with information in my SystemOut.log file? 

There are a few ways to correlate content in WAS logs/trace with content in javacore thread dumps: 

Best option, if you are using WebSphere Application Server 8.0 / 8.5: 

Applies to: 
WAS 8.0.0.4 and above running with Java 626 SR4 and above 
WAS 8.5.0.2 and above running with Java 7 SR3 and above or Java 626 SR4 and above 

In recent releases, we have made it possible to have the thread id used in the WebSphere Application Server log/trace match with the thread id used in javacores. In WAS 8.0.0.4 and above, you can use a system property to make the thread id in the logs/trace match the Java thread id. In WAS 8.5.0.2 and above, the thread id used in the logs/trace matches with the Java thread id by default. For more information, see PM60913: Introduce ability to use Java Thread ID in Logs instead of LogRecord Thread ID [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM60913] and JVM log interpretation [http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/wsbroker/redirect?version=phil&product=was-nd-dist&topic=rtrb_readmsglogs] 

Another option if you are using High Performance Extensible Logging (HPEL) / Binary Logging: 

Applies to: 
Full profile WAS 8.0.0.0 and above 
Liberty profile WAS 8.5.5.0 and above 

Full Profile: 
Use the HPEL logViewer command to output the logs in advanced format so you can see the full thread name: 
> logViewer -format advanced (basic is the default format) 

Liberty Profile: 
Use the binaryLog command line tool to output the logs in advanced format so you can see the full thread name: 
> binaryLog view --format=advanced 

You will get output that looks like the following: 

[4/14/11 9:41:45:218 EDT] 00000021 W UOW= source=com.ibm.somelogger.QuickLogTest org= prod= component= thread=[WebContainer : 4] 
The javacore contains the same thread name: 

3XMTHREADINFO "WebContainer : 4" J9VMThread:0x1578D700, j9thread_t:0x150D0D04, java/lang/Thread:0x02517CE0, state:R, prio=5
3XMTHREADINFO1 (native thread ID:0x15B0, native priority:0x5, native policy:UNKNOWN)
3XMTHREADINFO3 Java callstack:
4XESTACKTRACE at com/ibm/io/async/AsyncLibrary.aio_getioev2(Native Method) 
Another option if you are using Advanced format for your SystemOut.log / trace.log: 

Applies to: 
All currently supported WebSphere Application Server releases. 

Change your log/trace format to Advanced. The Advanced format contains the full thread name, as does the javacore. 

Advanced format Log: 

[4/14/11 9:41:45:218 EDT] 00000021 W UOW= source=com.ibm.somelogger.QuickLogTest org= prod= component= thread=[WebContainer : 4] 
The javacore contains the same thread name: 

3XMTHREADINFO "WebContainer : 4" J9VMThread:0x1578D700, j9thread_t:0x150D0D04, java/lang/Thread:0x02517CE0, state:R, prio=5
3XMTHREADINFO1 (native thread ID:0x15B0, native priority:0x5, native policy:UNKNOWN)
3XMTHREADINFO3 Java callstack:

 IBM SSLKeyException: RSA premaster secret error  Caused by InvalidKeyException - United States JDBC JCC SSL SSLKeyException .InvalidKeyException TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 My java application using the Data Server Driver for JDBC (JCC) is failing to establish SSL connection with following error:

SSLKeyException: RSA premaster secret error. Caused by: java.security.InvalidKeyException: Illegal key size or default parameters. 

SYMPTOM
javax.net.ssl.SSLKeyException: RSA premaster secret error. Caused by: java.security.InvalidKeyException: Illegal key size or default parameters 


CAUSE
The default restricted policy file has a 2048 key size limit. If the RSA key size exceeds this limit then this error is expected.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This issue can be resolved by upgrading to the unrestricted policy files, replacing the security policy files with the IBM unlimited cryptography files. Replace the local_policy.jar with the Unrestricted JCE policy File. [https://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/iwm/web/reg/pick.do?source=jcesdk&lang=en_US] 

 IBM Enabling tracing for the DASH service in Jazz for Service Management - United States DASHL2; DASHL2FAQ; DASHL2MUSTG; enable tracing TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What is the procedure to enable trace logging to troubleshoot DASH runtime issues/errors? 

CAUSE
You can use trace logging to assist in monitoring system performance and diagnosing problems. Since trace logs can be quite verbose and include many unrelated errors, resetting the logs and then reproducing the problem issue can reduce the time required for log analysis for specific issues.

ANSWER
Steps to enable tracing: 


Enable trace logging. 

 1. Log into the DASH. After logging in navigate to Console Settings [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21632844&amp;aid=1] > Websphere Administrative Console. 
 2. Navigate to Troubleshooting -> Logs & Trace 
 3. Click on the Server1 -> Select Diagnostic Trace Service. Increase the Maximum Number of Historical Files from 1 to 10. 
 4. Click Apply, then select Change Log Detail Levels. 
 5. Click on Runtime tab to enable tracing for the DASH process that is currently running. Enabling tracing from the Runtime tab will keep tracing active until the next time the DASH server process is stopped. To make tracing persistent even after stopping and restarting the DASH server process click the Configuration tab instead. 
 6. Clear the trace string in the Groups box and replace it with the following:
    
    *=info: com.ibm.isc.*=all: com.ibm.isclite.*=all: com.ibm.iscportal.*=all: com.ibm.isclite.service.datastore.consoleproperties.*=INFO
    
    For the Connection manager (data provider related issues) you will want to enable all for the following components:
    
    *=info: com.ibm.isclite.rest.*=all:com.ibm.tivoli.conmgr.*=all 
 7. Click on the Apply button. 
 8. If you enabled tracing from the Configuration tab in step 4, then click the "Save" link that appears at the top of the page. ("Save to master configuration")


Once tracing is enabled, reproduce the DASH runtime issue. Note the time that the issue was reproduced so that the issue can be easily correlated with the trace log entries. 

Run the log collector program:


 1. Change the directory to <JazzSM Home>/ui/bin 
 2. Run the following command:
    
    ./consoleLogCollector.sh or .bat
    
    Send us the console_logs.zip file located in <JazzSM Home>/ui directory


and attach them to the associated Problem Management Record (PMR). Please include the time the issue was reproduced in the PMR update. Please also provide the DASH version info:
<JazzSM Home>/ui/bin/consolecli.sh Version

Upload the resulting output file to the PMR

 IBM Specifying an alternative to "/tmp" for Tivoli Integrated Portal installs - United States TIPL2; TIPL2INST; tmp; temp directory; folder; Tivoli Integrated Portal; installation; fix pack TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Is there a way to configure the TIP installer to use an alternate directory if the installation user ID has insufficient access rights to "/tmp"? 

ANSWER
TIP L3 has examined the TIP installer and found that /tmp is hard coded in both the TIP and Websphere installers. There is no option available to override /tmp. To pursue a change to the TIP installer to accommodate an alternate tmp location, please submit an enhancement request via the RFE site here:

 IBM Can we remove world-writable permissions - global write permission - United States World writeable TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Setup a recurring process to remove world-writable from the files and directories: chmod o-w. We are not planning to delete any files. Would this impact functionality ? 

ANSWER
The question is whether or not it is safe to remove world-writable for these files and directories. Some of them are dynamic and will be re-created with world-writable after reboot. For these we would like to remove world-writable on a recurring basis. 

/export/opt/IBM/tivoli/tip/derby/TTSS Directory-Only /export/opt/IBM/tivoli/tip/derby/TTSS/log Directory-Only /export/opt/IBM/tivoli/tip/derby/TTSS/seg0 Directory-Only /opt/tivoli/cit/bin/etc Directory-Only /opt/tivoli/cit/bin/etc/wscanhw Directory-Only /opt/tivoli/cit/cache_data Directory-Only /tmp/javasharedresources Directory-Only /usr/ibm/common/acsi/logs Directory-Only /usr/ibm/tivoli/common/CIT/logs Directory-Only /var/.com.zerog.registry.xml File /var/ibm/common/acsi/resourceBundleLocation Directory-Only /usr/ibm/common/acsi/repos/persistSVCRepos Directory-Only /usr/ibm/common/acsi/repos/persistSVCRepos/* File /usr/ibm/tivoli Directory-Only /usr/ibm/tivoli/common Directory-Only /usr/ibm/tivoli/common/CIT Directory-Only 
Answer: 

DB2 is OK confirmed by DB2 support 
# Revoke world-writable from recurring DB2 log files 
/bin/chmod o-w 
/export/opt/IBM/home/tklmdb2/sqllib/db2dump/stmmlog/stmm.*.log 
/bin/chmod o-w 
/opt/IBM/home/tklmdb2/tklmdb2/NODE0000/TKLMDB/.SQLCRT.FLG 
/bin/chmod o-w 
/opt/IBM/home/tklmdb2/tklmdb2/NODE0000/TKLMDB/*/.SQLCRT.FLG 

Tested removing world-writable permissions on DB2 and it is OK. 

None of these files are TKLM specific. 

Some of these directories do not belong to TIP. 

CIT Files TKLM V2 doesn't have them: 
/opt/tivoli/cit/bin/etc Directory-Only 
/opt/tivoli/cit/bin/etc/wscanhw Directory-Only 
/opt/tivoli/cit/cache_data Directory-Only 
/usr/ibm/tivoli Directory-Only 
/usr/ibm/tivoli/common Directory-Only 
/usr/ibm/tivoli/common/CIT Directory-Only 
/usr/ibm/tivoli/common/CIT/logs Directory-Only 

Changed the permissions on those files. Everything looked OK: create a master keystore. create an LTO device. create a key, backup and restore, and apply a fixpack. 

Non-DE 
/tmp/javasharedresources Directory-Only 
/var/.com.zerog.registry.xml File Can be deleted

** Remove world writable permissions from DE directories. This will not impact functionality. 

It is OK to change the global write permission on above directories and files. 

 IBM MTTrapd [SNMP] probe drops traps from specific devices - United States nco_p_mttrapd; snmp; snmp traps; traps; dropped; drop; dropping; malformed; TCP TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 MMTrapd probe : Why are SNMP traps dropped from specific devices? 

CAUSE
SNMP packets can be dropped for a number of reasons, including overloading, malformed packets, malformed traps/informs and incorrectly configured/non-compliant MIBS.

ANSWER
Traps can be dropped during high loading, so ensure that the traps are being dropped from specific devices under normal load. 

Use snoop, tcpdump or Wireshark to capture the traps that are being dropped on the probe servers port, as defined in the property file. 

e.g.
Port : 162


Load the PCAP file into the Wireshark GUI and review the trap[s] visually. 


For traps to be processed they must have enterprise-oid and uptime, otherwise they will be dropped during probe processing by the NET-SNMP libraries.

Try setting Protocol to 'ALL' in case the trap is being sent as TCP|UDP.

For SNMPv3 trap and inform processing please refer to the available online FAQ's and supplementary documentation [see related information].

SNMPv3 traps require a unique creatruser entry for each device in the mttrapd.conf file, with the user definition including the devices unique engined-id. Whilst SNMPv3 INFORMs can be sent without an engine-id and a single createuser entry in the ConfPath's mttrapd.conf file.

If the trap appears to be RFC compliant, and MTTrapd probe is correctly configured, please send the PCAP file of the trap along with the probes debug log and property file to IBM Tivoli Netcool support for further analysis.

IMPORTANT: You should ensure that the latest MTTrapd probe and Netcool/OMNIbus fix pack is installed before contacting IBM Tivoli Netcool support, and that the problem persists with the latest product.

 IBM Setting a big session time-out value in DASH causes session lock-out - United States DASHL2; session; time-out; timeout; cannot login; locked out ; 2147483647; security.xml TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Using a big value (2147483647) for the session timeout setting in DASH, to achieve the maximum time between timeouts, is causing users to be locked out completely. 

SYMPTOM
After entering the user ID and password in the login page, and then pressing the "continue" button,
the login page does not change, stuck at "processing" and then returns to the login page again." 

All users get essentially locked out completely from DASH sessions.


CAUSE
In order to maximize the time between session timeouts, the customer is setting the timeout parameter in the security.xml file to 2147483647.

This timeout parameter used in the security.xml file is a WAS setting, but DASH is using a javascript call (settimeout), which causes a condition that prevents a login, if the timeout value is really big. 


Note: 2147483647 is the maximum positive value for a 32-bit signed binary integer in computing.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This condition that prevents logins can be averted by setting the custom property LTPAFIX in the consoleProperties.xml to "false". 


Please follow this steps: 

1. On DASH server, navigate to <JazzSM Home>/profile/config/cells/JazzSMNode01Cell/applications/isc.ear/deployments/isc/isclite.war/WEB-INF 

 
2. Take a backup of consoleProperties.xml 

 
3. Open consoleProperties.xml in edit-mode. 

 
4. Search for "LTPAFIX" and change the value from "true" to "false". 


Example: 

Before 
===== 
<consoleproperties:console-property id="LTPAFIX" value="true"/> 
</consoleproperties:ibm-portal-consoleproperties> 

After 
==== 
<consoleproperties:console-property id="LTPAFIX" value="false"/> 
</consoleproperties:ibm-portal-consoleproperties> 

5. Save the file. 

 
6. Restart DASH server.

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to install IBM Rational Asset Analyzer (RAA) Plug-in (RAAi) for IBM Rational Developer for System z (RDz) results in the error CRIMA1071E. 

SYMPTOM
You may receive a message similar to the following when installing RAAi in a RDz V9.0 environment: 

IBM Rational® Asset Analyzer Plug-in for IBM Rational Developer for System z® 6.1.0.0 cannot be installed into any package group.

CRIMA1071E: The installation package 'IBM Rational® Asset Analyzer Plug-in for IBM Rational Developer for System z®' requires components supplied by other packages.
The required components might be supplied by the following installation packages:
Package: Rational® Developer for System z 7.6


CAUSE
The RAAi installation program does not yet support RDz 9.0.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Install RAAi 6.1 into RDz 9.0 by manually copying the plug-in jar files to the Eclipsedropinsfolder. 


Follow the steps below to install RAAi:


 1. Find the jar files by opening the RAAiInstallRepository.zip file and looking in thepluginsfolder for these two files:  * com.ibm.dmh.raai_*.jar 
     * com.ibm.raa.integrate.doc_*.jar
       
       
    
    
 2. Find thedropinssubdirectory.  1. Right click on the properties to find the shortcut used to start RDz. 
     2. Look at theTargetproperty to see where eclipse.exe resides
        For example: C:\Program Files\IBM\SDP
        
        
    
    
 3. Create a dropinssubdirectory if one does not exist. 
    
    
 4. Copy the two jar files above to thedropinssubdirectory. 
    
    
 5. Restart RDz (Run as administrator)
    
    
 6. Verify you have an Asset Analyzerentry in the left pane after RDz restarts by clicking on Window > Preferencesfrom the menu.


If you later wish to delete this copy of RAAi 6.1, simply remove the two plug-in jar files that you previously copied into the dropins subdirectory.

 In the web server plug-in, what do the LoadBalanceWeight, MaxConnections, ConnectTimeout, ServerIOTimeout, RetryInterval, IgnoreAffinityRequests, and GetDWLMTable options mean and what are the recommended settings for these options?

What affect does Session Affinity have?

How are connections handled during plug-in fail-over?

What is the effect of using more than one web server child process? 

ANSWER
To understand how load balancing works in the web server plug-in, see Understanding IBM HTTP Server plug-in Load Balancing in a clustered environment [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21219567].

To understand how fail-over works in the web server plug-in, see Understanding HTTP plug-in failover in a clustered environment [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21219808].


LoadBalanceWeight is a starting "weight". The value is dynamically changed by the plug-in during runtime. The "weight" of a server (or clone) is lowered each time a request is assigned to that clone. When all weights for all servers drop to 0 or below, the plug-in has to readjust all of the weights so that they are above 0. Using a starting value of only 2 (default), means that the weights will get to 0 very quickly and the plug-in will constantly be readjusting the weights. Therefore, It is recommended to start with a higher LoadBalanceWeight. The IBM WebSphere Application Server administrative console will allow a value up to 20 for this. However, it is certainly possible to manually edit the plugin-cfg.xml file and specify some other value for LoadBalanceWeight that is higher than 20.

Note: At runtime, the LoadBalanceWeight of each appserver in a cluster are normalized by their highest common factor. For example, 100, 90, 80 have a common factor of 10. So, these configured weights would be divided by 10 at runtime, resulting in actual starting weights of only 10, 9, 8. Setting all clones to the same starting LoadBalanceWeight (for example: 20, 20, 20) will result in an actual starting weight of only 1 for each, because of normalization. So, it is recommended to set the weight of at least one of the clones to be off by a value of 1. For example, if there are 3 clones, you might choose the starting LoadBalanceWeights to be: 20, 20, 19. After normalization the weights will be unchanged.
Recommended values = all clones the same, except one clone off by one (for example: 20, 20, 19)


MaxConnections is used to gauge when a server is "starting to become overwhelmed". It is not used to determine when to fail-over (mark the server "down"). When a request is sent from the plug-in to the WAS appserver, it is called a "PendingRequest", until the response comes back. If the application running in WebSphere Application Server is handling requests quickly, each request will only be PENDING for a very short time. So, under ideal conditions, MaxConnections is not needed and therefore the default is (-1) meaning unlimited. However, sometimes an application may start to become overwhelmed and the application may not be able to handle the requests as quickly. Consequently Pending Requests start to build up. MaxConnections can be used to put a limit on the number of PENDING requests per server. When the MaxConnections limit is reached, the plug-in will stop sending requests to that appserver, but it is not marked down. The optimal value for MaxConnections will depend on how quickly the application and appserver respond to each request. If normal responses are returned in less than one second, it may be appropriate to set a low value for MaxConnections, like 20 or so. However, if it normally takes several seconds to get a response from the application, then it would be prudent to use a higher value for MaxConnections, like 100. Please note that if the MaxConnections limit has been reached the plug-in will not send ANY more requests to that server until responses come back for the current PENDING requests, and the pendingRequests count drops back down below the MaxConnections limit.
Recommended value = 20 - 100 depending on application response times

*Best Practices: with MaxConnections="-1" use LogLevel="Stats" to monitor the pendingRequests numbers in the plug-in log, under normal conditions. Then, choose a value for MaxConnections that is significantly higher than the highest number shown in the log. This method will help you to determine a MaxConnections value that is right for your specific environment.


ConnectTimeout means "how long should the plug-in wait when trying to open a socket to the Application Server"? If there are streams already open and available to the Application Server, the plug-in will use one of those. However, sometimes the plug-in needs to open a new stream to the Application Server. That should not take very long, so the value for ConnectTimeout should be very small. A ConnectTimeout value of 0 means never time-out. In that case, the time-out is left up to the OS TCP layer, which is NOT ideal. It is much better to specify a small positive number (like 5 seconds).
Recommended value = 5


ServerIOTimeout means "how long should the plug-in wait for a response from the application". After the socket is opened, the plug-in sends the request to the Application Server. The application processes the request and a response is sent back to the client, through the plug-in. How long should that take? What is reasonable, based on the application? There is no single correct answer here. It depends on the application. If the application is very quick to respond, then you can use a lower value for ServerIOTimeout. However, if the application requires more time to process the request (maybe to retrieve data from a database), then you should use a higher number for ServerIOTimeout. Using a value of 0 means that the plug-in will NOT time-out the request. This is often NOT ideal. A positive value means that the plug-in will NOT mark the appserver down after a ServerIOTimeout pops. So, if you want the plug-in to continue sending requests to the timed-out appserver, use a positive value. On the other hand, a negative value means that the plug-in WILL mark the appserver down after a ServerIOTimeout pops. So, if you want the plug-in to immediately mark the appserver down and fail-over to another appserver in the same cluster, use a negative value.
Recommended value = -900 (that is negative 900)

Note: The ability to use a negative ServerIOTimeout value was introduced in plug-in apar PK72097 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK72097].

*Best Practices: use traces to determine the amount of time it takes for your application to respond to requests under normal conditions. Be sure to include the longest running requests that take the most time to respond. Then choose a value for ServerIOTimeout that is much larger (2X or 3X or more) than the longest response time. This method will ensure that your ServerIOTimeout is high enough to allow adequate time for the application to respond normally. Make it a negative value so that if the ServerIOTimeout pops, the plug-in will immediately mark the server down, and retry the request to a different appserver.


ServerIOTimeoutRetry can be used to decrease the number of retries after ServerIOTimeout has fired. By default, the Plug-in will try a request equal to the number of members in the cluster. For example, if the cluster has four members, and there is a ServerIOTimeout, the Plug-in will try it a second time. If the retry fails with ServerIOTimeout fired, then it will try a third time, and a fourth time if needed. But after four attempts, the Plug-in will give up and stop retrying. If you want to override this default behavior and reduce the number of retries after ServerIOTimeout, you can set ServerIOTimeoutRetry to a value that is less than the number of members in the cluster.
Recommended value = -1 (this is the default)

Note: This property was introduced by Plug-in apar PM70559 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM70559].


RetryInterval is the time that the plug-in will wait before trying again to use an appserver that was marked down. The optimal value for RetryInterval depends on the number of appservers in the cluster, and the value used for ServerIOTimeout. You can use the following formula to determine the maximum RetryInterval value for your plug-in config:

(number of appservers in cluster - 1) x (absolute ServerIOTimeout) - 1

For example, if there are two appservers in the cluster, and the value of ServerIOTimeout is -900, then the maximum RetryInterval setting would be:
(2 - 1) x (900) - 1 = 899 seconds or less

Another example, if there are four appservers in the cluster, and the value of ServerIOTimeout is -900, then the maximum RetryInterval setting would be:
(4 - 1) x (900) -1 = 2699 seconds or less

Warning: Setting RetryInterval to a value higher than the recommended maximum, based on the formula above, can lead to an undesirable situation where all of the appservers in the cluster may be marked down simultaneously resulting in all requests temporarily failing.
Recommended value = 60 (this is the default)


Affinity requests are requests that contain a session cookie (ie. JSESSIONID). The session cookie is set by the Session Manager in WAS to ensure that all subsequent requests from the same client return to the same app server in the cluster. The session cookie contains the clone ID (or partition ID) of that specific app server. The web server Plug-in will look for the session cookie and use the clone ID to send the request to that specific WAS app server. An affinity request is not load balanced.

In the plug-in config there is a property called IgnoreAffinityRequests. This property determines if affinity requests will affect the load balance weights, or not. The default value for IgnoreAffinityRequests is True, which means that affinity requests will not have any affect on the load balance weights. This is best for environments where there are no, or few, affinity requests. On the other hand, for an environment with a lot of affinity requests, it may be better to set IgnoreAffinityRequests to False so that the load balance weights will accurately reflect the effect of having a lot of affinity requests.


Fail-over occurs when the plug-in marks a cluster member appserver (or clone) as "down", and then sends the pending requests to other members of the same cluster. This can happen if the plug-in is unable to open a new connection to the appserver within the ConnectTimeout. Or fail-over can happen if the plug-in has already sent the request to the appserver, but does not receive a response from the application within ServerIOTimeout. When the plug-in marks a cluster member appserver "down", it will handle the PENDING requests in one of two ways: Prior to plug-in apar PM12112 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM12112], the plug-in would send all of the pending requests to the very next appserver in the cluster. However, after plug-in apar PM12112 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM12112], the plug-in will randomly send the pending requests to any of the available appservers in the cluster. While the appserver is marked "down" the plug-in will no longer send any requests to it. After RetryInterval the plug-in will check to see if that appserver can be used successfully again. If so, the "down" flag will be removed and the appserver will be used again.

Note: By default, the number of attempts to handle a request is limited by the number of appservers in the cluster. For example, if there are only two appservers in the cluster, and the request fails once, the plug-in will only attempt that request one more time (total of two attempts). Or another example, if there are five appservers in the same cluster, and the request fails once, then the plug-in will attempt to retry that same request up to four more times (total of five attempts). That number includes retries sent to the same appserver (session affinity), or attempts sent to different appservers (fail-over).

Update: The plug-in apar PM70559 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM70559] introduced a new setting called "ServerIOTimeoutRetry" that can be used to control the number of retries due to ServerIOTimeout.


If Memory-to-Memory (M2M) session replication is enabled in WebSphere Application Server, then the GetDWLMTable setting in the plug-in config must be changed to "true". Memory-to-Memory replication uses partition IDs rather than clone IDs. This can lead to broken session affinity if GetDWLMTable is set to false (which is the default). So it is very important to set GetDWLMTable="true" whenever using M2M in WebSphere Application Server.
Recommendation = GetDWLMTable="true" whenever M2M is used in WebSphere Application Server.


Each web server child process loads a separate instance of the web server plug-in. And multiple running instances of the web server plug-in do not share information with each other. For example if the IBM HTTP Server web server is configured to start 3 child processes (StartServers 3), then there will be 3 instances of the web server plug-in running (one for each IBM HTTP Server child process). The dynamically changing LoadBalanceWeight of each cluster member is not shared between the plug-in instances. So, in one instance of the plug-in "member1" might be considered UP with a weight of 5, when in another instance of the plug-in "member1" might be considered DOWN and unusable. This can result in possibly different behaviors depending on which child process / plug-in instance handles each incoming request. For this reason it is recommended that you should configure the web server to use only a few web server child processes with many threads on each. See Tuning IBM HTTP Server to maximize the number of client connections to WebSphere Application Server [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21167658].

If you choose to use more than one web server child process, keep in mind that the plug-in settings are handled on a per instance basis. For example, MaxConnections means the number of pending requests that will be allowed on that server, for each plug-in instance. If MaxConnections = 20, and there are 3 web server child processes (3 plug-in instances), then each instance will allow 20 pending connections to that Application Server for a total of 60 pending connections.

 IBM Performance issue on Mac OS X Launching and Closing SPSS Statistics 21 or 22. - United States Mac OS X; Performance; open; close; exit; launch; 10.6.x 10.7.x 10.8.x 10.9.x TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 With SPSS Statistics 21 or 22 software installed on Mac OS X. 
The software was running normally, but for what ever reason, the program might fail or close improperly by using Force Quit several times. 

CAUSE
This has been identified as a product defect under APAR PM90266

ENVIRONMENT
This technote applies with any Mac OS X compatible with Statistics 21 or 22, Not version 23. 

- IBM SPSS Statistics 21 release is supported on Apple Macintosh 10.6 (Snow Leopard), 10.7 (Lion), and 10.8 (Mountain Lion) with Intel processor. 

- IBM SPSS Statistics 22 release is supported on Apple Macintosh 10.7 (Lion), and 10.8 (Mountain Lion) with Intel processor. 
Note: IBM SPSS Statistics 22 for Macintosh (Mavericks, OSX 10.9 Operating System) is not officially supported until Statistics 22 FixPack 1 is released. 


Note: Windows computers see 
Technote 1652535
http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21652535 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21652535]

Note: For Statistics 23.0 Windows or Mac OS X, refer to technote: 1640411
http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21640411 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21640411]


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
One or more of the following symptoms might occur that this resolution can solve. 

(1) Statistics takes an abnormally longer time to start and close than when the software was initially installed. 

(2) Very slow response and performance with using the software. 

(3) The 'Data Editor' menu no longer appears under the Main menu bar.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Delete the following file: com.ibm.spss.plist on your Macintosh to dramatically reduce the opening and closing of the Statistics software. 

- You can delete it by opening the Finder and locate the Library/Preferences folder: /Library/Preferences/com.ibm.spss.plist
(1) Restart your Mac.
(2) Open 'Finder'.
(3) Select the 'Home' (house) icon (folder) in the left-hand pane.
(4) Select the 'Go' menu at top of screen.
(5) Press the 'Option' key. The list of menu options will now include 'Library'.
(6) Select the 'Library' menu option.
(7) Open the 'Preferences' folder.
(8) Rename the com.ibm.spss.plist object to old_com.ibm.spss.plist 


- Another option is to use the Terminal application and do the following:
rm -fR ~/Library/Preferences/com.ibm.spss.plist 

 

Finish and test your changes by doing the following: 

(9) Launch Statistics
(10) Work with the program a bit.
(11) Close the software (It should be quicker, do not force quit)
(12) Re-launch Statistics
(13) Work with the program a bit.
(14) Close the software (do not force quit)
(15) Launch the software 


NOTE: When you launch Statistics for the first time, it will take a little longer than subsequent launches, until you reboot your computer again. This is related to Java initialization routines. 


- FYI: Additionally, if you are using Mac OSX Mavericks 10.9.x, you need to stop the process that protects this file and restores it (it is deleted):

Since OSX 10.9.x Mavericks a cached copy of your "plist" file is stored that uses a background process: CFPREFSD
Deleting the "plist" file and restarting SPSS Statistics does not create a new copy of these files.
Rather, Mavericks restore its cached copy. 
Only by stopping the "cfprefsd" process and starting SPSS Statistics, will it generate a new "plist" preference file and default toolbar.

When you go to Finder - Applications - Utilities and open Activity Monitor on the 10.9.x computer you see that there is a CFPREFSD process visible for root user and for the current logged in user.
You need to stop the CFPREFSD process for the current user. Do so in the Terminal application by running the following command:

killall -u {CURRENT_USER} cfprefsd

Where {CURRENT_USER} is replaced with the person's user ID. One can get the user ID by typing "whoami" at a Terminal prompt. 

Should removing these files and running the program does not resolve the issue, you might need to remove all of them and reinstall the program.

 IBM Recognition gives Word too tall error with IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture - United States recognition OCR OCR_A OCR_S TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When performing recognition on an image, recognition fails. The RRS log entry shows:

Word too tall, removed. 

CAUSE
This error can occur when the height of the word in pixels exceeds the configured limit. It can also occur when the recognition engine cannot identify the boundaries of the word.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Do one of the following as appropriate for the situation. 

 * Verify that the newest recognition engine is being used. Currently this is done using the RecognizePageOCR_S action from the ocr_sr library. 
 * Increase the height limit for the action using SetMaxCharacterHeightTMM(x) where x represents the height in pixels. Default depends on the DPI, but for 300 DPI is 64. 
 * Reduce the height of the word in pixels. This may be done either by making the word smaller, or by reducing the number of pixels per inch for the tiff. 

 IBM DOORS module fails to open in exclusive edit mode results in error "unable to open module ...no such file or directory" - United States missing session file; file not found; can not open module; open module exclusive edit fails; PM50525 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to open a module exclusive edit in IBM Rational DOORS result in the error "DOORS report
Unable to open module '/A Project/Requirements' No such file or directory". 

SYMPTOM
A module with a large number of sections is used mostly in shareable edit mode. 

You can open the module Read-only , or Shareable-Edit; but not in exclusive edit. 

Steps to reproduce: 

 1. Login to DOORS
    
    
 2. Click the Project, or folder, icon that contains the module
    
    
 3. Click the module icon in the DOORS Explorer window
    
    
 4. Click File > Open> Exclusive Edit (Ctrl + E)
    


Expected result: The module should open in Exclusive edit mode.  

Actual result: The module will not open in exclusive edit module; however it will open in read only mode, or shareable edit mode. If you attempt to check the database integrity for issue the module is not flagged for any problems. 

The full error message is as follows:

DOORS report
Unable to open module '/A Project/Requirements' No such file or directory"
C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\Rational\DOORS\9.5\data\v6data\20\m00000021.mod\current.ver\s1000005.dtc

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21511831&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21511831&aid=1]

CAUSE
 This issue has been identified as a product defect under APAR PM50525 [http://ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM31236].



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This error indicates that a user session file is corrupted on the database server. 

This defect is resolved in IBM Rational DOORS Version 9.4.0.1 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27036720#9401] 

 

WORKAROUND: 

the following options can be used to correct this problem: 

 * Retrieve the missing file from system backup and insert it into the module current.ver directory
   
   The advantage of inserting the missing session file is you do not need to restart the database server.

Warning these two option should only be performed by Rational Support. Modifications to the files in your DOORS database could result is data corruption and jeapordize your DOORS database. Send the session.ixc file to support for repair

From the module directory listed in the error message provide support the file session.ixc
Choosing to have support repair the session index file requires you to have all users log out 
and shut down the DOORS database server until the repaired file is returned and inserted 
to replace the existing data file for the module.

Create a replacement session file 
From the module directory listed in the error message provide support the file session.ixc
Adjacent session files will be required in order to to create the replacement. 
Your support engineer will identify these files from the session index file.
No work can be performed in the effected module until the replacement session file is restored
for the effected module.  


Note: Generally the repair is only required for one user session file. However in circumstances where DOORS reports a missing session file for a module- the event that caused this may have effected session files for other users connected to the module. For this situation you may need to perform a successive repair to the index file.

 IBM Client IP address missing from the X-Forwarded-For header - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why is the Front End Load Balancer ( FELB ) not forwarding a client IP address to a backend? 

ANSWER
This is a known limitation in the current implementation of haproxy ( FELB ), especially with the layer 7 where SSL termination is handled.
Notice that forwarding a client IP address to a backend works when the FELB is setup to use non-SSL configuration. 

 IBM Batch job fails with ABEND 102 REASON 00000000  
DUMP TITLE=CSQ1,ABN=102-00000000 ...  Mismatch code levels - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Your WebSphere MQ (WMQ) batch job abends with an abend 102 - 00000000
ABEND102 ABENDS102 S102 

CAUSE
One reason for Abend 102-00000000 - 

Mismatch in code levels between WMQ MSTR (Queue Manager) and the batch job

The S102 is occurring as the batch job is running with V701 libraries (for example, SCSQAUTH dataset which contains CSQBSRV, CSQBCON etc) against a V710 queue manager. In order to run against a V710 queue manager the V710 libraries need to be used by the batch job. 
In order to connect to a V710 queue manager the application needs to run with a V710 SCSQAUTH. The V710 SCSQAUTH will allow an application to connect to both a V710 or a V701 queue manager. 
This is documented in the Information Center (section 'z/OS: Planning for migration from WebSphere MQ version 7.0.1 to WebSphere MQ version 7. [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.mq.doc%2Fmi77108_.htm]1'; 


 * 


Per ' Application migration and interoperation [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.mq.doc%2Fmi23001_.htm]' topic, WebSphere MQ does not support connecting server applications loading libraries from the earlier level to connect to a later level of queue manager. On z/OS the STEPLIB must reference the target libraries for the queue manager. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
In IPCS you can view level of CSQBSRV in the batch job address space.

 IBM Modifying the default Monitoring Level and Sampling Rate in the J2EE v7.1.1.0.0 agent. - United States J2EE TEMA Monitoring Level Sampling Rate xml files CAMADALL CAMJ2INST DC WebLogic TECHNOTE (FAQ)

THIS DOCUMENT APPLIES ONLY TO THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGE VERSION(S):
 US English 

QUESTION
 How do I modify the default Monitoring Level and Sampling Rate in the new J2EE v7.1.1.0.0 agent? 

ANSWER
In the older release of the J2EE agent (v6.2 FP6), there was an option to specify the Monitoring Level, Sampling Rate and other parameters (threshold values, time intervals, etc..) during the configuration phase of the agent itself. This is now not possible in the new J2EE agent v7.1.1.0.0 configuration panels as these options are not available anymore. 

The default values for the Monitoring Level and the Sampling Rate are L1 and 2% respectively. If you want to change these default values permanently, then please make these changes.

In the $ITM_HOME/config (Unix) dir or %ITM_HOME%\TMAITM6 (Windows), you will find the <hostname>_yj.xml file. Make a copy of this file, then stop the agent and make changes to the parameters (see screenshot below) in the file. Save file, restart the agent. The new values will now be accepted in the agent. If you are deploying a new Weblogic application, stop the agent, modify the <hostname>_yj_<wls_instance>.xml file then restart the agent again.

 IBM Ignorable SYSIBMADM.DBCFG IS AN UNDEFINED NAME error message - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)

QUESTION
 The default password does not fulfil corporate security requirements. 

CAUSE
The default password is blank

ANSWER
Looking into guides for this third party software shows HSQLDB command line capability as being: 

 * 
 * SET PASSWORD
 * 
 * 
 * SET PASSWORD <password>;
 * 
 * 
 * Changes the password of the currently connected user. Password must be double quoted. Empty password can be set using "".


An example of changing the password in HSQLDB as above by connecting to the database: 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


and issuing the command: 

 * 


quitting: 

 * 


and logging back in with the new password: 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


The above example login uses the default ImpactServer name (NCI) and HSQLDB port number (5435). The default password is blank. 

One will have to edit the HSQLDB DataSource to enable it to connect to the database with the new password. 

A) One method is by encrypting the password and editing the HSQLDB DataSource to allow DSA connection. Use nci_crypt to encrypt the password - for example: 

 * 
 * 
 * 


edit the file: 

 * 


to alter the property: 

 * 


from the default value of {aes}9C71E0F544E705326E2B5CBDFC54CE46 to the new encrypted password value - for example: 

 * 


This requires an ImpactServer restart to enable. 

B) An alternate method is to edit the DataSource via the normal Impact configuration GUI and provide the new password there. This alternate method has the advantage that one does not need to perform the encryption oneself, nor does one need to manually edit the configuration file and nor does one need to perform an ImpactServer restart to read up the new configuration into the memory resident database that is the ImpactServer.

 IBM Fix list for IBM Content Navigator Version 3.0.0 - United States  PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION

ABSTRACT
 The following table contains the complete listing of fixes for Version 3.0.0. 

CONTENT
APARs fixed in IBM Content Navigator Version 3.0.0 

APAR Description IO24490 (IBM FileNet P8 users) When EDS is used to hide workflow properties in the in-basket filter, moving the input focus through each visible workflow property field with the tab key causes a null script error when the next field is hidden. This also causes the input focus to stop moving to the next visible field.
With this fix, the tab key moves the input focus through each of the visible fields. IO24492 (IBM Content Navigator for Microsoft Office users) When the LTPA token times out, the SSO Kerberos does not recover.
With this fix, the user connection is reestablished. IO24514 (IBM Content Manager users) Child attribute values are not exported with the other attributes. [https://cmdtsweb4.usca.ibm.com:9449/jazz/resource/itemName/com.ibm.team.workitem.WorkItem/84947] 
With this fix, the child attributes and the values are exported. IO24539 (IBM FileNet P8 users) When criteria are entered into the workflow in-basket filter, pressing the Enter key does not close the filter dropdown and apply the filter criteria.
With this fix, the Enter works as expected. IO24544 (IBM CMIS for Content Manager users) Administrators must restart CMIS after modifying the Content Manager data model for users to see the changes.
With this fix, the Content Manager configuration cache is cleared and the data model changes now appear. IO24653 (IBM Content Navigator for Microsoft Office users) Users are unable to select a different document class when adding an email from Outlook.
With this fix, users can change the document model class. IO24710 (IBM FileNet P8 users) When users attempt to download documents with the Download All action and the user does not have permission to open all of the documents, the user receives an error.
With this fix, the user receives a friendly error message that the user does not have sufficient permissions. IO24711 (IBM FileNet P8 users) After editing the properties of multiple documents or folders that have an entry template, the reference to the entry template is lost after changes are saved.
With this fix, the entry template information is retained. IO24745 (IBM FileNet P8 users) The annotateEdit HTML parameter is set to true but annotation editing remains enabled.
With this fix, the annotateEdit parameter disables annotation editing. IO24752 (IBM Content Navigator for Microsoft Office users) When the locale is set to a RTL orientation, some choice lists remain set to LTR.
With this fix, the choice list option orientation is set correctly. IO24757 (IBM CMIS for Content Manager users) When files of 0 byte length are encountered, the document id is not retrieved.
With this fix, the document id, cmis:contentStreamId, is available in the response metadata when using IBM Content Manager Search API. IO24759 (IBM Content Navigator users) When using the sample feature, the ‘Get Next’ button does not work.
With this fix, the ‘Get Next’ button retrieves the next document. IO24765 (IBM FileNet P8 users) When a search returns more than the maximum count of items, the count displays as 0.
With this fix, the message will reflect that the maximum count was exceeded. IO24777 (IBM CMIS for FileNet users) [https://cmdtsweb4.usca.ibm.com:9449/jazz/resource/itemName/com.ibm.team.workitem.WorkItem/84806]CMIS logs an error that parsing runtime descriptor failed.

With this fix, the name property is used for the document title. IO24909 (IBM Content Navigator users) When a multi-line value is first displayed in an entry template property layout text area field, the complete value is not displayed. The text area field does not resize to display the full value until the input focus enters the text area field.
With this fix, the text area displays the value as expected. IO24944 (IBM Content Manager users) Navigator does not allow a user to change the class of a document with content to another class if the user does not have permission to add content to the target class. IBM Content Manager does not require the permission to add content to the target class.
With this fix, the user can change the class. IO24949 IBM Content Manager OnDemand users) Decimal numbers are not sorted properly when the server is set to a locale that uses a comma to indicate the decimal place, i.e., French.
With this fix, decimal numbers are sorted properly. IO24952 (IBM Content Navigator users) In a load balanced environment, if the client IP address for a request changes for an active session, the application executes an invalid DNS look up for each request after the client IP address change which can add a significant delay to the time it takes to process each request.
With this fix, the invalid DNS look up is not executed. IO24953 (IBM Content Navigator for Microsoft Office users) When uploading a document, the user can manipulate the upload path and save documents in a restricted folder.
With this fix, the user to limited to folders they have permissions for. IO24965 (IBM FileNet P8 users) Sometimes adding the related child document fails.
With this fix, the child document provides an error that document import failed. IO24972 (IBM Content Manager users) When using a layout and a dependent property is linked to a foreign key, the dependent property is not displaying the default foreign key values when the parent property value changes.
With this fix, the foreign key default choices are updated properly as the user changes the parent property value. IO24973 (IBM Content Navigator users) When using the Paste action from the context menu to paste the password into the Password field, the login button is not enabled. 
With this fix, the Paste action enables the Add button. IO24985 (IBM Content Navigator for Microsoft Office users) Users can not install on Windows 10 if .Net 4.6.2 is already installed.

 IBM How to create a custom group/role for Cognos Workspace and/or Cognos Workspace Advanced - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This document will explain the steps necessary to create a group or role within the Cognos Namespace that can be used to assign only rights for Cognos Workspace Advanced and/or Cognos Workspace (or as they were formerly known in 10.1.1 / 10.1 Business Insight Advanced and/or Business Insight.). 

CAUSE
IBM Cognos Licensing might require a Group of Users to be able to only access Cognos Workspace or Cognos Workspace Advanced (Business Insight or Business Insight Advanced).

ENVIRONMENT
IBM Cognos Installation with Cognos Workspace (Business Insight) and Cognos Workspace Advanced (Business Insight Advanced).

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Based on the following steps the group or role will only have access to either Cognos Workspace (Business Insight) or Cognos Workspace Advanced (Business Insight Advanced). Even though the Role receives Traverse and Execute permissions for the Report Studio capability it will not be able to open Report Studio (this is only possible if you have Traverse and Execute permissions for the Professional User Interface Profile).





First create your group or role in the Cognos Namespace: 

1. Launch IBM Cognos Administration 

2. Select the Security Tab 

3. Choose Users, Groups and Roles 

4. Click on the Cognos namespace. 

5. Click "New Role" or "New Group" 

Then you will have to apply the following settings:
R=Read
T=Traverse
W=Write
X=Execute 

Permissions on Capabilities [Cognos Administration->Capabilities]:
Cognos Viewer: TX
Run With Options: TX
Collaborate: TX
Executive Dashboard: TX
Executive Dahsboard -> Use Advanced Dashboard Features: TX (10.2.x and Up)
Executive Dahsboard -> Use Interactive Dashboard Features: TX (10.2.x and Up)
Report Studio: TX
Scheduling: TX
Watch Rules: TX

Report Studio Profiles: TX [This is "set properties" directly on Security Tab->User Interface Profiles]
Express: TX [This is below User Interface Profiles]

Permissions:
Public Folders: RTWX
Express Authors (on itself): RTX [Replace this with your Group located in Cognos Administration->Security tab->Users,Groups,Roles->Cognos-><your Express Group>]

To remove the Group/Role access to Cognos Workspace (Business Insight) do the following access:
Cognos Administration->Security Tab->Capabilities->Executive Dashboards (Cognos Workspace/Business Insight)->Set Properties 
Your group/role then receives deny on Traverse and Execute. 

To remove the Group/Role access to Cognos Workspace Advanced (Business Insight Advanced) do the following:
Cognos Administration->User Interface Profiles->Drop Down Symbol next to Express->Set Properties
Select your group and change Traverse and Execute to Deny.

You can create unique Groups/Roles to cater to every requirement separately.

 IBM TEP Login is failing for some LDAP users - United States KFW_AUTHORIZATION_USE_EWAS; TEPS; Login ; LDAP ADO; status 1021 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The TEPS is configured to use LDAP (e.g. Microsoft Active Directory ) for user authentication.
Some LDAP user are able to login successfully, but some users are not able to login, why? 

SYMPTOM
For some users that try to log into the TEPS, the following error is seen: 

"KFWITM393E User ID or password is invalid" 

 

The TEPS logs shows the error:
KFW1002I Starting Service: 'Startup Complete v2.0' (Thursday, August 28, 2014, 3:12:36 PM-{252C}ctserver.cpp,520, "CTServer::startServerDll") KFW1003I Started Service: 'Startup Complete

Monitoring 

 IBM SelfMonitoring events incorrectly cleared - United States netcool; impact; netcool/impact; nci; 610; self; monitoring; selfmonitoring; service; event; events; problem; resolution; clear; clears; generic; genericclear; delete; deleteclears; automation; object; server; objectserver; objserv; nco; omnibus TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 All SelfMonitoring Service problem (Service stopped) events are cleared by GenericClear if any single resolution (Service started) event is created 

SYMPTOM
A Service is stopped and a SelfMonitoring (problem) event is sent to the ObjectServer. 

Another Service is stopped and that too creates a SelfMonitoring (problem) event in the ObjectServer.

The second Service is then restarted and SelfMonitoring sends a resolution (Service started) events to the ObjectServer and this results in BOTH Service stopped events being set to Severity 0.



CAUSE
SelfMonitoring Service events do not include any details of the Service in question in the fields used by the GenericClear Automation in the ObjectServer to uniquely identify and correlate Problem and Resolution events - so any single SelfMonitoring Service Resolution event will correlate with ALL SelfMonitoring Service Problem events and set the Severity to 0 for the DeleteClears Automation to mop up. 





DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
SelfMonitoring Service events for known stopped Services are vanishing when they shouldn't. 





RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The easy solution at this time is to upgrade to Fix Pack 1 or higher. One could go to the extremes of creating a PolicyActivator, polling at a higher rate than the GenericClear Automation, to run a Policy to pick-up these events, pull out the Service name from the Summary field and append it to the Agent field of the events so that the GenericClear Automation can uniquely identify and correlate Problem and Resolution events. 


This problem is recorded by APAR IV13297 "ALERTKEY VALUE FOR SELFMONITORING (SERVICE) EVENTS DOES NOT INCLUDE SERVICE DETAILS, SO GENERICCLEAR CLEARS ALL SUCH EVENTS." [link below] and is fixed in IBM Tivoli Netcool/Impact V6.1.0 Fix Pack 1 (6.1.0-TIV-NCI-FP0001) [link below] and above.

 IBM Health Check events Node and Domain and their interactions. - United States HealthCheck failed events; nco_p_ncpmonitor.rules; VirtualDomain TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 HealthCheck failed events are being received, nco_p_ncpmonitor.rules has been customized. 

SYMPTOM
Although both the Primary and Backup domains are up and (according to their mutual VirtualDomain processes) are healthy, each is sending Health Check Failed events for the other domain.


CAUSE
This document only applies to those installations where the nco_p_ncpmonitor.rules file has been edited to modify the inserted value for @Node in alerts.status or where @Node is being modified for health check events by some other external process. 

Each ITNM Gateway (ncp_ncogate) in the Primary and Backup domain retrieves health check events from alerts.status and constructs an update into the state.domains table in the VirtualDomain process. Please review the documentation in the 'Related Information' section below for more information on the Health Check process.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
When you run the ncp_ncogate process in debug you can see the update that the gateway makes in state.domains. The value for m_Domain should be the same as the Domain name for the Primary or the Backup domain. It should not be the name of the Virtual domain. 


ProcessHealthCheck sent:update state.domains set m_HealthStatus=1 where m_Domain='ITNM';


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The value for m_Domain is taken from the value for Node (@Node) in alerts.status for the health check event. If you have altered the inserted value for @Node, either by modifying the nco_p_ncpmonitor.rules file or by some other method such as an Automation or Impact policy, then the resulting update for state.domains will fail. Ensure that the rules governing the modification of @Node allow for the value of @Node to remain unchanged for health check events.

To resolve the problem, select either option: 

 * Download and install a later Java 32-bit x86 AMD/Intel Java SDK from [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg24023707]the WebSphere Support web site [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24028881] to the IBM HTTP Server java and plug-ins java folder.
   
   
 * Download and install the files from the Unrestricted JCE policy files [https://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/iwm/web/preLogin.do?source=jcesdk] site. 
   
   After downloading the unrestricted JCE policy files, follow the instructions below to replace the restricted JCE policy files with the unrestricted JCE policy files.


Instructions: 
1. Rename and move the restricted JCE Policy files indicated below from the <ihsinst>/java/jre/lib/security/ directory to a directory that is outside the JDK class path, extdirs, or bootclasspath. 

local_policy.jar 
US_export_policy.jar 

2. Next, place the unrestricted JCE policy files in the <ihsinst>/java/jre/lib/security/ directory. They should be named local_policy.jar and US_export_policy.jar 

3. Finally, restart the ikeyman utility to pick up the unrestricted JCE policy files now located in the security directory 

Very Important Note: You will be offered two options to download. See screen shot below. The correct Unrestricted JCE policy files will depend on the JAVA SR version. This can be verified, Run java -version command from the <ihsinst>/java/jre/bin directory. The output will display the Java SR version.

 IBM SQL1763N error with Reason Code 11 while running "Alter Tablespace" command to reclaim unused storage space against DMS or automatic storage tablespaces. - United States SQL1763N; Alter Tablespace; reclaimable storage; DMS; Automatic storage table spaces; MON_GET_TABLESPACE; RECLAIMABLE_SPACE_ENABLED; SMS; DB2 Version 9.7; lower high water mark TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Receiving SQL1763N error with Reason Code 11 while running "Alter Tablespace" command to reclaim unused storage space against DMS or automatic storage tablespaces. 

SYMPTOM
Following reasons apply: 

 * If the DMS or automatic storage tablespaces are not created in DB2 Version 9.7 or later, as the "Reclaimable Storage" is not available in tablespaces created in earlier versions(V9.1/V9.5) of the DB2 product. 
 * Trying to alter a SMS tablespace as this feature is not supported on SMS tablespaces. 


Example testcase on a TEMPSPACE1 SMS tablespace. 

 * 
 * 
 * DB21034E The command was processed as an SQL statement because it was not a valid Command Line Processor command. During SQL processing it returned: SQL1763N Invalid ALTER TABLESPACE statement for table space "TEMPSPACE1" due to reason "11" SQLSTATE=429BC 
 * 
   


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
MON_GET_TABLESPACE table function and RECLAIMABLE_SPACE_ENABLED monitor element can be used to identify whether the tablespace is enabled for reclaimable storage or not. Example: 
db2 "SELECT varchar(tbsp_name, 30) as tbsp_name, tbsp_type, RECLAIMABLE_SPACE_ENABLED FROM TABLE(MON_GET_TABLESPACE('',-2))" 

 

Snippet of the output: 

 

TBSP_NAME TBSP_TYPE RECLAIMABLE_SPACE_ENABLED
----------------- ----------- -------------------------
SYSCATSPACE DMS 1
TEMPSPACE1 SMS 0
USERSPACE1 DMS 1 

If the RECLAIMABLE_SPACE_ENABLED monitor element returns a value of 1, then the tablespace is enabled for reclaimable storage. Otherwise, it returns a value of 0.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To use the reclaimable storage feature, make sure to create the DMS or automatic storage tablespaces in DB2 Version 9.7 or later. Example testcase on SYSCATSPACE DMS tablespace which has reclaimable storage enabled. 

 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


Note: 
Tablespaces migrated from DB2 V9.1/V9.5 to V9.7 won't get upgraded directly to use the reclaimable storage feature. RELATED INFORMATION

 IBM DB2 UDB Version 8, v10.5 compliance with FIPS 140-2 standard - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Is DB2 v8, v10.5 compliant to FIPS 140-2 ?. 

ANSWER

Is DB2 v10.5 compliant with FIPS 140-2?

Q: Is DB2 vulnerable to the problem described below?

V-58165 DBMS main in the middle attack [https://www.stigviewer.com/stig/database_security_requirements_guide/2015-06-23/finding/V-58165]

"One class of man-in-the-middle, or session hijacking, attack involves the adversary guessing at valid session identifiers based on patterns in identifiers already known. The preferred technique for thwarting guesses at Session IDs is the generation of unique session identifiers using a FIPS 140-2 approved random number generator. However, it is recognized that available DBMS products do not all implement the preferred technique yet may have other protections against session hijacking. Therefore, other techniques are acceptable, provided they are demonstrated to be effective. "

A: No because DB2 does not use session ids for authentication and thus not vulnerable to the attack described above. DB2 uses encryption modules which are FIPS 140-2 certified.

DB2 v8.x compliancy to FIPS 140-2

DB2 v8.x went out of support in April 2009.

What is ICC?

ICC (IBM Crypto for C) is a set of libraries from Tivoli® for performing encryption. As of DB2® Universal Database™ (DB2 UDB) Version 8 fixpak 7 (equivalent to DB2 UDB Version 8.2), DB2 is using ICC on most platforms.

Customers who need to operate in an environment that is compliant with FIPS 140-2 federal standard should take into account the releases of ICC that are shipped by DB2 on different platforms and the compliance status of those releases with FIPS 140.2.

Following is a list of platforms on which DB2 is using ICC for encryption of data flowing between clients and servers:

DB2 V8 Fixpak 7 through DB2 Fixpak 11: 
ICC Version 1.2.2 on platforms:
AIX 32 bit
HP-UX PA-RISC 32 bit
ICC Version 1.2.1 on platforms: 
AIX 64 bit
HP-UX PA-RISC 64 bit
HP-UX IA64
Linux x86, Linux x86-64, Linux IA64
Linux for zSeries
Linux for POWER
Windows x86 and IA64
Solaris SPARC 64 bit
ICC Version 1.3.9 on platforms:
Solaris x86-64 (DB2 V8.2 GA)

DB2 V8 Fixpak 12 and later: 
ICC Version 1.4.1 on platforms 
AIX
HP-UX PA-RISC
Linux x86 and x86-64
Linux for zSeries
Linux for POWER
Windows x86 and x86-64
Solaris SPARC
ICC Version 1.3.9 on platforms 
HP-UX IA64
Linux IA64
Windows IA64

Summary of known problems encountered in ICC 1.2.1/1.2.2:
There are a number of issues with DB2 and the ICC encryption libraries at levels prior to 1.3.9. The known problems are: 


 1. Severe performance problems where processes seem to hang, or take several minutes to run. 
 2. A bug in ICC code causes it to communicate with the OpenSSL EGD (Entropy Gathering Daemon) which under certain circumstances could hang 
 3. ICC symbols have not been namespaced and DB2 can end up with symbol collisions with OpenSSL code. This can also happen when multiple versions of ICC are used within the same process.


DB2 Version 8 Fixpak 12 and later incorporates IBM Crypto for C (ICC) version 1.3.9 or 1.4.1 cryptographic module which fixes these problems. 

 

Note: The latest status of ICC conformance with FIPS 140-2 standard can be obtained by referring to http://www.ibm.com/security/standards/st_evaluations.shtml [http://www.ibm.com/security/standards/st_evaluations.shtml]

DB2® Universal Database™ (DB2 UDB) has an internal trace facility called "db2trc". This trace facility acquires Inter Process Communication (IPC) resources (both semaphore and shared memory). Even though a DB2 trace is not turned on, it may issue semget() calls to the operating system. These calls will fail, though, since no IPC resources were acquired.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The trace facility has an "alloc" option that can allocate necessary IPC resources. When you issue db2start, internal functions equivalent to command db2trc alloc are automatically issued, and when you issue db2stop, the trace segment will be removed if no one is using it.

Since a DB2 client does not necessarily have the ability to perform the db2start command, no IPC's will be automatically allocated for the trace facility, and hence the problem.

The solution is to issue the following command at the DB2 client:

db2trc alloc

This will then create the necessary IPC resources, and prevent the semget() calls from failing (since the semget() call now has IPC resources that it can use). The potential performance problem will thus be avoided.

The failed semget() operations are more of a concern for Solaris Operating Environment, Linux®, HP-UX and AIX® operating systems, in terms of performance implications. Windows® will not have this problem due to its specific architecture.

The db2trc alloc command should be invoked every time the client is restarted, and therefore it is recommended to add this command to a startup script.

Note: To determine if the application is issuing semget() calls, the best course of action would be to take a "truss". Please read your operating system manuals on how to perform and read a truss.

 IBM Business Process Manager users receive errors that session has expired - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 If you are using CA Wily Introscope to monitor performance in the same environment with IBM Business Process Manager, you might receive messages that a user session has expired. Before you can continue working on IBM BPM, you must log out and log in again. 

CAUSE
WebSphere Application Server has session security integration enabled by default. Enabling this feature guards against the possibility of session data being hijacked by another user. 
The Wily Introscope agent might try to access an active user session to monitoring purposes. Because Wily does not have the same authenticated user, the session security integration feature prevents Wily from accessing that user session. 

By having a custom property named InvalidateOnUnauthorizedSessionRequestException set to true, the session manager will invalidate the active user session. This causes the "session expired" messages for the IBM BPM user. (The default value for InvalidateOnUnauthorizedSessionRequestException is false.)


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
To verify you have this problem, you can turn on tracing for the Web container, the session, security, and IBM BPM using these tracing strings: 


*=info:com.ibm.ws.webcontainer*=all:com.ibm.wsspi.webcontainer*=all:HTTPChannel=all:GenericBNF=all:com.ibm.ws.session.*=all:com.ibm.ws.security.*=all:com.ibm.websphere.security.*=all:com.ibm.websphere.wim.*=all:com.ibm.wsspi.wim.*=all:com.ibm.ws.wim.*=all:WLE.*=all 

You might see entries in the stack trace similar to the following lines:

at com.wily.introscope.agent.servlethelper.ServletRequestHelper.getSession(ServletRequestHelper.java:286)
at com.wily.introscope.agent.servlethelper.ServletRequestHelper.get(ServletRequestHelper.java:513)

at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:784)



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To prevent the sessions from expiring, choose one of the following options: 

 * Stop the Wily agent. 
 * Remove the custom property InvalidateOnUnauthorizedSessionRequestException=true by completing the following steps: 1. Log in to the administrative console. 
   
   2. Click server_name > Session Manager > Custom properties. 
   
   3. Select the InvalidateOnUnauthorizedSessionRequestException property, which is set to true, and delete it.
   The purpose of this setting in BPM default configuration is to "gracefully" terminate existing sessions and create new sessions in shared browser scenarios. With this setting removed, you may see temporary exceptions in cases two users share the same browser instance and try to switch identity without closing the browser in between. 
   
   4. Click Apply and then save the master configuration. 
   
   5. Restart the servers. 
   
   
 * Disable specific Wily configurations that reuse the session IDs from existing users.

PROBLEM
During the 8001 fix pack installation, ConfigEngine executes a wsadmin script which tries to read the server definition for any vertical cluster members added to the node. If the Dmgr was not running during the upgrade, it may fail.

SYMPTOM
In ConfigTrace, the process is not connecting to the Dmgr:
========================================

If a default profile exists and you wish to use it, the -profileName
parameter is not required.

[exec] Current profile - wp_profile
========================================

CAUSE
The Dmgr is not started during the upgrade, so the installation process cannot connect to it.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1. If using a remote Dmgr, be sure it is started prior to attempting the upgrade. 

2. If using a local Dmgr and Installation Manager requires you to stop it prior to attempting the upgrade, follow these steps:
a. Verify the Dmgr profile name by navigating to the Dmgr's AppServer/bin folder and execute this command:

./manageprofiles.sh|bat -listProfiles

b. Pass in the correct Dmgr profile name according to the installation option you are using:

 IBM MQ 7.1 and later: How to remove a channel authentication record (CHLAUTH) - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 You have added a channel authentication record into a WebSphere MQ 7.1 or later queue manager:

SET CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER(testuser) USERSRC(CHANNEL) ACTION(ADD)
AMQ8877: WebSphere MQ channel authentication record set.

Then you display it:

DISPLAY CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP)
1 : DISPLAY CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP)
AMQ8878: Display channel authentication record details.
CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP)
CLNTUSER(testuser) USERSRC(CHANNEL)

Now you want to remove it and you try executing the following runmqsc command which you constructed using copy and paste from the above output:

DELETE CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER(testuser) USERSRC(CHANNEL)
3 : DELETE CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER(testuser) USERSRC(CHANNEL)

You get the following error:

AMQ8405: Syntax error detected at or near end of command segment below:-
DELETE CHLAUTH

The DELETE CHLAUTH does not exist and after consulting the MQ 7.1 Information Center you read that you have to use the SET CHLAUTH command with the argument ACTION(REMOVE). You try now:

SET CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER(testuser) ACTION(REMOVE)
19 : SET CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER(testuser) ACTION(REMOVE)

But you get the following error:

AMQ8884: Channel authentication record not found.

You specified the attribute CLNTUSER(testuser) as it was shown in the output of the DISPLAY CHLAUTH(*), thus, you think the record should be found. You want to know what is the problem?


CAUSE
See the following section of the MQ 7.1 documentation:
WebSphere MQ > Administering > Administering local WebSphere MQ objects > Performing local administration tasks using MQSC commands
WebSphere MQ object names [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_7.1.0/com.ibm.mq.doc/fa11060_.htm]
+ Case-sensitivity in MQSC commands
MQSC commands, including their attributes, can be written in upper-case or lower-case. Object names in MQSC commands are folded to upper-case (that is, QUEUE and queue are not differentiated), unless the names are enclosed within single quotation marks. If quotation marks are not used, the object is processed with a name in upper-case. 

When specifying the SET command with the following value CLNTUSER(testuser) the string 'testuser' will be folded to upper-case resulting in the following value being actually used by runmqsc:
CLNTUSER(TESTUSER)
And in this case, there is no record for the user TESTUSER (the record is for 'testuser').


ANSWER
NOTICE that the userid mentioned in the CLNTUSER field of the output of the DISPLAY CHLAUTH command is NOT surrounded by single quotes. 

However, you MUST include the single quotes when specifying the value during an ACTION(REMOVE):

SET CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('testuser') ACTION(REMOVE)
1 : set CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('testuser') ACTION(REMOVE)
AMQ8877: WebSphere MQ channel authentication record set.


++ Example of record with more attributes

Let's examine the case when a record has more attributes, such as:

SET CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('client_1') USERSRC(MAP) MCAUSER('user_1') ADDRESS('*') ACTION(ADD)
AMQ8877: WebSphere MQ channel authentication record set.

display CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL)
9 : display CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL)
AMQ8878: Display channel authentication record details.
CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP)
DESCR( ) CUSTOM( )
ADDRESS(*) CLNTUSER(client_1)
MCAUSER(user_1) USERSRC(MAP)

You want to delete the record and you try the following command which is based on the command that worked well for a simpler case. But this time, it fails:

SET CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('client_1') ACTION(REMOVE)
AMQ8884: Channel authentication record not found.

You try the original command that created the record, but changing the action to REMOVE:
SET CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('client_1') USERSRC(MAP) MCAUSER('user_1') ADDRESS('*') ACTION(REMOVE)
AMQ8885: Parameter not allowed for this action on a channel authentication record.

The attribute USERSRC is not a valid parameter for the REMOVE action (see table below).
Therefore, by removing this attribute, then the following command worked successfully to remove the record:
SET CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('mengano') ADDRESS('*') ACTION(REMOVE) 
AMQ8877: WebSphere MQ channel authentication record set.

See:
WebSphere MQ 8.0.0 > IBM MQ > Reference > Administration reference > MQSC reference > The MQSC commands >

 IBM MQ 7.x, MQ 8.0 and MQ 9.0 compatibility with previous versions - including usage of CCDT files, JMS .bindings, SSL/TLS - United States compatibility; compatible TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Are WebSphere MQ (WMQ) V7.0, V7.1, V7.5 and V8.0 compatible with previous versions?
Can an MQ 8.0 client use a CCDT created with a previous version?
Can an MQ 7.0 client use a CCDT created with a newer version?
Can a JMS .bindings file created in 7.1 be used with 8.0?
Can a JMS .bindings file created in 8.0 be using with 7.1?
Can an older MQ client using an old SSL protocol still work with MQ 9.0?


ANSWER

Compatibility statement:

WebSphere MQ V7.0, V7.1, V7.5, V8.0 and V9.0 queue managers and clients inter operate with queue managers and clients from any previous level of the WebSphere MQ or MQSeries products.

This means that ... 

 *  A 7.0, 7.1, 7.5, 8.0 and 9.0 client can connect to all queue managers, non-version 7, as well as version 7.0, 7.1, 7.5, 8.0 and 9.0 
 *  A 7.0, 7.1, 7.5, 8.0 and 9.0 queue manager can interact with all clients, non-version 7, as well as version 7.0, 7.1, 7.5, 8.0 and 9.0


Note: If your V7.x, V8.0 or V9.0 client connects to an MQ 6.0 or earlier queue manager, or use a server-connection channel with the attribute SHARECNV = 0 (which treats the connection as being MQ 6.0), then you cannot use V7 features, and structures in your client application. 


MQ Client V6 and V7/V8/V9 compatibility 

The new features which are available for a version 7.x, 8.0 or 9.0 client connected to a version 6.0 queue manager are: 
- Weighted selection on CLNTCONN channels. 
- Reconnecting via a previously used channel. 
- Maximum message length increased on MQSERVER environment variable. 

The new feature which is available for a version 6.0 client connected to a version 7.x, 8.0 or 9.0 queue manager is: 
- Instance limits on SVRCONN channels. 


Caveat 

The compatibility statement refers to: 
Version.Release 

... such as: 
A 7.0 client is compatible with a 7.5 queue manager. 

This statement does not extend to a more granular specification: 
Version.Release.Maintenance.FixPack (V.R.M.F) 

If there are known problems at a given V.R.M.F (such as 7.0.0.0), then an upgrade to a more recent fix pack for the same Version.Release will be necessary (such as 7.0.1.11). Notice that the upgrade is within the same Version.Release (7.0) and a migration to a newer Version.Release is not forced. 


+ Compatibility of MQ clients and CCDT files 

Newer versions of the MQ clients (such as 8.0) know how to handle CCDT files that were created/edited by older queue managers (such as 6.0) 

Older MQ clients (such as 6.0) do NOT know how to handle CCDT files that were created/edited by newer queue managers (such as 8.0). That is, older clients do not know what are the new attributes (if any) introduced in newer MQ versions. 

Based on the above, if you have a mix of versions of MQ clients that use a common CCDT file, then this CCDT file should be edited from a queue manager at the LOWEST (OLDEST) version. For example, if you are using MQ 6.0, 7.0, 7.1, 7.5, 8.0 and 9.0 clients that use a CCDT file, then the CCDT file must be maintained by the MQ queue manager at version 6.0 
- However, the newer MQ clients (8.0) when using the CCDT created with 5.3 will NOT be able to fully exploit newer features, even when connecting to an 8.0 queue manager because the CCDT will not show the new attributes for those new features. 

MQ CCDT created version Compatible MQ client versions 

6.0 6.0 7.0 7.1 7.5 8.0 9.0 
7.0 7.0 7.1 7.5 8.0 9.0 
7.1 7.1 7.5 8.0 9.0 
7.5 7.1 7.5 8.0 9.0 
8.0 8.0 9.0 
9.0 8.0 9.0 

Notes: 
- There was no change in the MQCD length between 7.1 and 7.5. Therefore the CCDT created on 7.5 can be used on 7.1. 
- There was no change in the MQCD length between 8.0 and 9.0. Therefore the CCDT created on 9.0 can be used on 8.0. 
- Unless documented otherwise, CCDTs created on higher level maintenance releases (for example 8.0.0.3) are compatible with lower level (for this example: 8.0.0.0) MQ clients running the same MQ version and release. 

Update on July 2016: 
There are 2 APARs that allow OLDER MQ clients to use NEWER CCDT files! 
These APARs relax the restriction by allowing newer CCDTs to be used on older clients but with the caveat that the older client cannot make use of any of the newer channel attributes. These attributes will assume their default values when the CCDT is negotiated with the queue manager.

- A JMS .bindings file that was created at an older version (such as 7.1) than the MQ JMS client (such as 8.0) will be used without version related errors by the client. 

- A JMS .bindings file that was created at a newer version (such as 8.0) than the MQ JMS client (such as 7.1), will be used without version related errors by the client. If there are any new attributes in the JMS administered objects that the older client cannot read, they are ignored. 


+ Compatibility of SSL/TLS cipher specifications 

There have been changes in recent fix packs related to the compatibility of SSL/TLS cipher specifications. For example, if you have a MQ Client at 7.1.0.1 connecting to a MQ 8.0.0.1 queue manager using an older SSL cipher specification, after applying Fix Pack MQ 8.0.0.2 to the queue manager, the connectivity may be broken because the queue manager indicates that the older SSL cipher spec is now deprecated. 

For more details on the compatibility of SSL/TLS cipher specifications, see the following blog entry: 

SSL and TLS Cipher Specification Deprecations for the MQ Product [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/aimsupport/entry/ssl_and_tls_cipher_specification_deprecations_for_the_mq_product?lang=en] 
Miguel A. Rodriguez 
May 2016 
Due to the recent security vulnerabilities (for example, POODLE Attack), the latest MQ product Fix Packs come with stricter, default security requirements that affect the use of the compromised Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Weak Transport Level Security (TLS) Cipher Specifications. Since these Cipher Specification deprecations are disabled in MQ Fix Packs by default, review the article for the changes separated by MQ versions and Fix Pack levels. RELATED INFORMATION

 IBM Web Browser Versions Supported by PathWAI Editor for Messages - United States Web Browser Internet Explorer Editor for Messages 5724K3700 5724K3700TR TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Which web browser versions are supported by Editor for Messages? 

ANSWER
Editor for Messages supports Microsoft Internet Explorer only. Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome are not supported.

Supported IE versions: 
IE 6, IE 7, IE 8, IE 9 (compatibility view), IE 10(Compatibility view), IE 11(Compatibility view)

Note:
There are known issues which cause functions not to work correctly with IE 9 or above. For example, the check boxes for queue filters at the right side do not work correctly, and the open queue messages dialog shows in minimum small size. As a workaround, IE compatibility view is recommended. The following explains how to enable it.

1. Enter the URL to connect with Editor for Messages Web Server. In my case, 9.123.109.109 is the server IP. 
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21678261&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21678261&aid=1]
Screenshot 1

2. Right click on the menu Tools –> Compatibility View. From now on, all views from this site will be displayed in IE compatibility view. You may also add the IP to the compatibility view setting (see screenshot 2) by selecting Tools -> Compatibility View Settings, then it will open following dialog. Now, input the server IP address to add and click ‘close’ to save.

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21678261&amp;aid=2]
Screenshot 2

After this, you do not need to select the compatibility view every time when IE is launched. IE will open the site automatically in compatibility view. 

 IBM WebSphere Portal inactive session time out and redirect - United States redirect; session; time out; session time out; redirect.logout.url; redirect logout TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
A redirect to a specific page in IBM WebSphere Portal does not always occur when an inactive session times out or the inactive session time out does not appear to occur at all. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
You set the following properties in the WP_ConfigService and notice different behavior when the session times out (depending on your version of WebSphere Portal): 

 * 
 * redirect.logout = true
 * 
 * redirect.logout.url = <Fully Qualified URL>


The session inactivity time out is 30 minutes but this value does not affect this issue. 
RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In V6.1.0.1, when the session expires, you are redirected to the page specified in the redirect.logout.url property. 


In Portal 6.1.0.1 with APAR PK78213 installed or in V6.1.0.2 and later, you are not redirected to the login page. Instead, the ErrorSessionTimeOut.jsp displays: 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21419230&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21419230&aid=1]

By design, the ErrorSessionTimeOut.jsp always displays when the session times out if a logout URL is configured.

On systems running V6.1.0.1, install APAR PK78213 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK78213] to maintain consistency across all 6.1 platforms. 

To redirect to the login page (or any other page) when the session expires, use one of the following methods:


 * 
 * 
 * 
 * "Configuring authentication filters"
 * 
 * New security APIs in WebSphere Portal
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


NOTES 

1. This document discusses redirect behavior on session timeout. An "explicit" logout (by selecting or clicking the logout link) is always expected to cause a redirect to the URL specified in redirect.logout.url. 

2. The inactive session timeout may not work at all in a single node cluster or a cluster with "failover" nodes in which only 1 node is up at a time (for example, when using Portal Express). Either add a second node or set the value for Distributed Sessions from "Memory-to-memory 
replication" to None in the WebSphere Application Server Integrated Solutions Console, path: Servers > Server Types > Websphere application servers > WebSphere_Portal > session management > Distributed environment settings. RELATED INFORMATION

 IBM Files requiring modification when updating, upgrading, moving, or migrating a System Monitor MSSQL database in IBM Enterprise Content Management System Monitor 5.2 - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What files require modification when updating, upgrading, moving, or migrating a System Monitor MSSQL database in IBM Enterprise Content Management System Monitor 5.2 

ANSWER
The files are:
$CENIT_ROOT/cala_rex/cfg/cala_rex_finca.cfg

$CENIT_ROOT/cala_rex/cfg/cala_rex_srv.cfg

$CENIT_ROOT/.prodinfo/FSM_SERVER.settings

$CENIT_ROOT/eventserver/cfg/db-cfg.xml

$CENIT_ROOT/gui/cfg/db-cfg.xml

$CENIT_ROOT/initdb/cfg/db-cfg.xml



There is a chance that a monitor could be configured to check the status of the monitor's database server, in which case the MSSQL database server name is also defined in this file:

$CENIT_ROOT/cala/misc/cmdtab_merged.ctb.


Please note: If the port, user, or password changes, these must also be reflected in the above files.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
For CVE-2015-7575: 

Users of Java 7 and later can address the issue by updating the ../jre/lib/security/java.security file as follows (both steps are required): 

· Add MD5 to the jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms property - for example jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms=MD2, RSA keySize < 1024, MD5 

· Add MD5withRSA to the jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms property - for example jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, RC4, DH keySize < 768, MD5withRSA 

Java 6 requires code changes in the JSSE component in addition to the java.security file modifications, so upgrading the JRE is the only solution.

 IBM Newly accessed tables result in increasing of dbheap - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Newly accessed tables result in increasing of dbheap 

SYMPTOM
From output of command "db2pd -db <db name> -mempools" you can find LogSz/PhySz of the memory pool named "dbh" keeps on increasing.


CAUSE
This is expected result. Every newly accessed table loads the tcb and has associated allocations for data, index, lob, compression dictionaries if applicable. This memory allocation is persistent/cached until the database deactivates or the table is dropped.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Collect "db2pd -db showdb -memblocks 2 sort -alldbp", you will find most of the the newly memory allocations are from File 1601762203 LOC 1025 and LOC 1015:

2 dbh 40057088 0.77 174834 19.78 3159 1235116617

Note, for different versions, LOC might be different, above LOC only applies to V9.7FP11.

Collect "db2pd -d showdb -tcbstats -alldbp", you will see the number of tcb entries also keeps on increasing.





RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This is the expected result, once all tables in the database are accessed for at least one time, the memory increasing will stop.

Note, for different versions, LOC might be different, above LOC only applies to V9.7FP11.

Collect "db2pd -d showdb -tcbstats -alldbp", you will see the number of tcb entries also keeps on increasing.





RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This is the expected result, once all tables in the database are accessed for at least one time, the memory increasing will stop. 

 IBM WebSphere Adapter for JD Edwards, Version 7.5 system requirements - United States DSRDoc; DetailedSystemRequirementsDocument PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION

ABSTRACT
 This techdoc lists the system requirements for IBM WebSphere Adapter for JD Edwards, version 7.5. 

CONTENT
The information provided here describes the minimum product levels you need installed before opening a problem report with the WebSphere Adapters support team. Because other products frequently ship fixes, updates, and new releases, it is not possible to test every configuration. In general, you can install and run updates to supported products if those updates are compatible with later versions. This statement does not apply to enterprise information system (EIS) product versions and their dependencies. Specific cases where this statement is not applicable are indicated where relevant. 

Supported JD Edwards versions  * EnterpriseOne Tools 8.97, 8.98 ( JD Edwards Adapter Inbound, Outbound operations) 
 * EnterpriseOne Tools 9.1 ( JD Edwards Adapter from Version 7.5.0.2 onwards) 
 * EnterpriseOne Tools 9.1.4 ( JD Edwards Adapter from Version 7.5.0.5_IF06 onwards)

Note : For v9.1.4,the JDE user login password and security password should be same. Otherwise, there may be a chance of hitting the login issues while using the real time events and XML list query

Note: The adapter is compatible with any version of JD Edwards EnterpriseOne that works with the supported versions of EnterpriseOne Tools.
EnterpriseOne Tools 8.9 SP1, 8.9 SP2, 8.93, 8.94, 8.95, 8.96 are supported only for application design, development, and testing; there is no support for production use. Those versions are deprecated because Oracle does not support them. Supported databases All databases supported by the products listed in the Software requirements section.

   ****************************************************************
   SECJ0371W messages log every event of an LTPA token
   expiration. LTPA token expirations are expected under normal
   circumstances. Although at times these messages can alert
   customers to unexpected conditions. For instance a client
   continues to send an expired token repeatedly.
   The customer is requesting the ability to disable the logging
   of the SECJ0371W message.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A security custom property will be used to disable the logging
   of the SECJ0371W message. Setting this property to true will
   disable future logging of the message.

 IBM How to Proxy SSL request from DataPower to Remote Proxy Server? - United States Forward Proxy XMLFW MPGW CONNECT TUNNEL TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How to configure an IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance Service to proxy an SSL request to a remote proxy server using the CONNECT method for SSL tunneling? 

CAUSE
Many common forward proxy servers expect requests in different formats depending on if they are proxying non-SSL or SSL requests.

For example, a non-SSL request to be proxied may come in the form of GET hostname:port/URI.

For SSL requests to be proxied, remote proxy servers are commonly configured to tunnel the request from the client to the backend server.

In the SSL request scenario, remote proxy servers will typically expect a CONNECT request and then tunnel the SSL request from the client to the backend server.

Users configuring DataPower may need a way to implement this CONNECT method for SSL tunneling to a remote Proxy Server.




RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Non-SSL Proxy requests will work using either:

a) an XML Firewall when configuring in the HTTP Options tab, where the user can configure the Proxy Host and Port

b) a Multi-Protocol Gateway when configuring an HTTP Proxy Policy in the User Agent

SSL Proxy requests will work using the CONNECT method for SSL Tunneling when using a Multi-Protocol Gateway when configuring in a User Agent's HTTP Proxy Policy.

The XML Firewall service is not designed to use the CONNECT method for SSL Tunneling. 

 IBM What are the supported Apple Macintosh Operating System Versions for IBM SPSS Statistics? - United States SPSS mac macintosh Apple Macintosh statistics OS supported version compatibility matrix leopard Snow Leopard Lion Mountain Lion 10.8 Mavericks 10.9 22 Yosemite 10.10 (Yosemite) el capitan 10.11 spss 24 Sierra 10.12 High Sierra 10.13 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I would like to know what are the supported Macintosh Operating system versions for IBM SPSS Statistics versions? 

ANSWER
Please see the list below. It is strongly recommended to review the platform information on IBM Software Product Compatibility Reports [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/prodguid/v1r0/clarity/index.jsp]. The installation of IBM SPSS Statistics software on Apple Macintosh OSX operating systems requires an Intel processor. 

A) Apple Macintosh MacOS High Sierra (10.13) 

Support for IBM SPSS Statistics 25 only. Please note that no other SPSS release will be officially supported on High Sierra, but older versions like SPSS Statistics 24 may run as well on High Sierra. 

NOTE: There's a known issue with some of the earlier release of Mac High Sierra system (13.0 and 13.1 beta version). 
The top menu of SPSS 25 may disappear if the Mac OS system is set to Non-English. 
The official MacOSX 10.13.1 version do not have this issue. So, if you encountert this issue you need to update your Mac OS version to latest official 10.13.1 build from Apple. 

 

B) Apple Macintosh MacOS Sierra (10.12) 

Support for IBM SPSS Statistics 25 and IBM SPSS Statistics 24 only. For release 24 It is also recommended to install the latest FixPack 2 for release 24 on Mac [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24043574]. [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24042675] 

No older SPSS Statistics releases are supported on Sierra. 

 

C) Apple Macintosh OSX El Capitan (10.11) 

Support for IBM SPSS Statistics 24. Please see the Release notes - IBM SPSS Statistics 24.0 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27047057] for known issues on Macintosh. 

Full documentation including installation material provided in different languages and manuals for release 24 can be found on IBM SPSS Statistics 24 Documentation [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27047033] webpage. 

 

Also, Support for IBM SPSS Statistics 23. Note: if you want to install on El Capitan, please refer to technote 1970391 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21970391] 

 

D) Apple Macintosh OSX Yosemite (10.10) 

Support for IBM SPSS Statistics 24, IBM SPSS Statistics 23 and IBM SPSS Statistics 22 

 

Note: Mac OSX 10.10 (Yosemite) was released on Thursday, October 16th 2014 by Apple after Statistics 22 was released. If you like to use Statistics 22 on Yosemite you need to install Statistics 22 Fixpack 2 as well. Statistics 22 FixPack 2 and release Statistics 23 are fully tested on Yosemite OSX 10.10. So if you like to run Statistics 22 on Yosemite please install Statistics 22 FixPack 2 and also read the section below: 

**** 

In some instances it can be necessary to re-install the legacy Apple Java 6 on 10.10 for the use of Statistics 22 FixPack 2 on this platform

Download and re-install Apple Java 6 

- After you upgraded your Apple Mac OSX from a previous release to 10.10, Apple Java 6 may no longer exists on your upgraded system. If you then launch Statistics 22 which is an application that relies on Java 6, it can happen, the Mac OS pops up a dialog box stating Java 6 was requested, but none is present.
- The Java dialog has a "More Info" button, which when clicked opens a browser to an Apple Tech Support page for Apple Java 2014-001. A download link is provided:
http://support.apple.com/kb/dl1572 [http://support.apple.com/kb/dl1572]
- Click on the download link and a DMG containing the Java 6 installer is downloaded.
- Then you open the Java DMG, double click on the Java installer, follow the prompts and complete the installation of Java 6.

******* 

 

E) Apple Macintosh OSC Mavericks (10.9) 

Support for IBM SPSS Statistics 23 and IBM SPSS Statistics 22 

*** 

Note: IBM SPSS Statistics 22 was developed and released prior to Apple's release of OS X 10.9 (Mavericks). However, Statistics 22 can be installed on Mac OSX 10.9 if you install Apple Java SE 6 (1.6.0_65) on OS X 10.9 first before you install Statistics 22. Please see http://support.apple.com/kb/dl1572 [http://support.apple.com/kb/dl1572] for download. 

****

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Configuration of the ITCAM agent on AIX leads to Java heap errors. 

SYMPTOM
During configuration of the YN agent, you will see these errors: 

java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space

java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
CFG5045E The configuration process is being terminated due to errors listed above.


CAUSE
Low heap settings in the JAVA_OPTS parameter.


ENVIRONMENT
AIX - Distributed



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The Java heap settings are set in the config.sh script in the JAVA_OPTS line. For AIX, the default settings are way too low. 

Please do these changes to get it to work: 

Make a backup of the config.sh file, then edit it. 

Search for the following line JAVA_OPTS in the config.sh file:[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21959444&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21959444&aid=1] 

Change the JAVA_OPTS="-Xms256m -Xmx256m" to a higher value like this: 

JAVA_OPTS="-Xms512m -Xms512m" 

Save file, restart the config again and see if it works now without any Out of Java heap messages.

 IBM Optimizing barcode recognition with IBM Datacap - United States bar code barcode recognition optimization patch code patchcode TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What can be done to give the best results with barcode recognition? 

CAUSE
During printing, the ink can bleed or spread out over the white area, and then, during scanning, additional spreading of black may occur. As a result, the white spaces end up disappearing and the bars blend into each other. This can be seen by looking at the scanned image at high magnification. The barcode must meet the specifications after accounting for this.

ANSWER
To optimize barcode recognition: 

 * The width of the thinnest bar (called the X-dimension) must be at least one pixel, and two pixels are recommended for best results. At 200 DPI this means each bar must be at least .01 inch. Generally this translates to about 4 to 5 characters per inch. 
 * The X-dimension or width of the narrowest black bar and white space between bars must be at least 20 mils (1/50 inch, 1/2 mm). When scanned perfectly at 200 DPI this would result in 4 pixels, and at 300 DPI 6 pixels. 
 * For Code 39 symbols: a 20 mil X-dimension results in a density of approximately 3.6 characters per inch. Optimally the height should be at least 1/4 inch or 15% of the width, whichever is greater, though this is not an absolute requirement. The minimum quiet zone (white space before and after the bar code) specified by the standard is 1/5 inch. 
 * Scanning can sometimes introduce white or black stripes on the image running in the scanning direction, typically vertical stripes if the paper is scanned in Portrait orientation. Bar codes printed in normal horizontal orientation cannot be read reliably when this occurs. It is advisable to print barcodes perpendicular to the direction of scanning. If the barcode must be printed horizontally on a page, scanning in landscape orientation will make the barcode more robust in the presence of common scanner issues. 
 * By default, Datacap only accepts barcode images with 71% confidence or higher. To modify it to accept low confidence barcodes also, add the following action to run prior to barcode detection:  * SetMinimumConfidenceBP(1) - This is equivalent to 11% confidence. Each increment increases the required confidence 10% and higher values can be used if false barcodes are detected. A value of 4 is usually sufficient for this purpose.
   
   
 * Barcode recognition has an internal barcode enhancement capability. To maintain high performance, this feature is turned off by default. If low quality barcodes are being received, it may be desired to turn on barcode enhancement, despite the performance hit. To do this, add the following action to run prior to barcode detection:  * rrSet(1,@P.bp_enhance)
   
   
 * Performing Datacap's regular image enhancement (ImageFix) prior to running any barcode recognition action is not recommended. ImageFix is designed to optimize text recognition and can actually degrade the barcode. There are some rare exceptions, and if it is necessary to use image enhancement prior to barcode recognition, pay close attention to the configuration settings, especially vertical line removal and despeckle. To ensure image processing is not interfering with barcode recognition, test with the ImageFix() action removed.

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The snippet results cache feature is disabled by default in some NPS releases. Review this topic to learn how to enable the feature if your queries could benefit from it. 

CAUSE
Starting with the June 2015 fix packs for NPS 7.1.0.6 and 7.2.0.5, and the NPS 7.2.1 release, the snippet results cache is disabled by default because it was optimized for specific workloads. Starting in the March fix packs 7.1.0.9, 7.2.0.8, and 7.2.1.2, the feature is enabled by default because it is optimized for most workloads. 

ENVIRONMENT
Netezza Platform Software releases 7.1.0.6 through 7.1.0.8-P1, 7.2.0.5 through 7.2.0.7-P1 and 7.2.1 through 7.2.1.1-P1

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Queries that take advantage of the snippet results cache have longer runtimes after upgrades from any 7.x release to a release listed in the Environment section.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The snippet results cache is a query optimization feature added in NPS release 7.1 that can help to improve the performance of small queries. The feature was enabled by default for the NPS 7.1 releases up to 7.1.0.6 and for 7.2 releases up to 7.2.0.5.


The snippet results cache saves the intermediate results of snippets and can reuse them rather than incur the processing time to recompute them when needed. The cache can help to improve the performance of small queries. 

However, in environments where queries run against tables that constantly change with TRUNCATE, load, updates, and/or rollback operations, caching may not be a good match if cached snippet results are frequently invalidated before they can be reused. 

If you upgrade from any 7.x release to a release listed in the Environment section and detect a change in query performance for queries that take advantage of the snippet results cache, you can re-enable the feature.

To enable the feature on a session level and test the snippet results cache behavior, you must pause the NPS system, set the variable, and resume the system, as follows: 

nzsystem pause -force
nzsystem set -arg system.srcMode=1 -force
nzsystem resume

This setting remains in effect until the database is restarted. You can add the definition to the system.cfg file to keep the setting in effect after the Netezza software restarts:


 1. Log in to the Netezza system as the nz user account.
    
 2. With any text editor, open the /nz/data/config/system.cfg file. 
    
 3. Look for a system.srcMode definition in the file to make sure that one is not already present and/or commented out. If you find an entry, make sure that system.srcMode=1 is set and not commented out with a # character. If you cannot find an entry, add system.srcMode=1 to the file. 
    
 4. Save and close the system.cfg file.
    
 5. Stop and restart the NPS software using the nzstop and then the nzstart commands. 

 IBM Installation Manager 1.7.3.1 or older cannot connect to HTTPS servers that have SSL security protocol disabled - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When using IBM Installation Manager to connect to a HTTPS server, if the server has SSL disabled, versions of IBM Installation Manager older than 1.8 will not be able to connect to it 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
IBM Installation Manager has added support for the TLS protocol in versions 1.8 and 1.7.4. Versions of the Installation Manager that are 1.7.3.1 or older, require SSL security protocol to connect to a HTTPS server. 
To resolve the issue, update IBM Installation Manager to version 1.7.4, 1.8 or newer.

 IBM Insufficient ulimit Value Causes Native OutOfMemory - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 An out of memory may be observed on a system running WebSphere Application Server on Linux or AIX that is due to ulimit restrictions on number of process/threads per user. Further investigation may reveal a "Failed to create a thread:" message within the generated javacore which would indicate a native out of memory issue has been encountered. The cause of the problem may be an insufficient ulimit setting. While this type of issue can occur on any level of Linux, or AIX, the issue is most likely to be seen in systems running multiple instances of WebSphere Application Server using one userid. The following will outline how to identify if a process ulimit is the culprit and what WebSphere Application Server Support recommends to fix the case. 

SYMPTOM
An out of memory Dump Event such as: 

"systhrow" (00040000) Detail "java/lang/OutOfMemoryError"
"Failed to create a thread: retVal -1073741830, errno 11" received

Note: This detailed message will appear only in javacores.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
When using WebSphere Application Server, ulimits can be set to fix or tune around a number of problems. For more on how to set a ulimit refer to the "Guidelines for setting ulimits [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21469413]" Technote which goes into detail on setting different ulimits on various operating systems and the difference between the soft and hard limit. This article is concerned particularly with the "-u" ulimit or "nproc" limit on Linux, the ulimit - r on AIX which affects the number of threads allowed for a single user process running WebSphere Application Server. 

The AIX issue is less commonly seen as it limits then number of threads for a process but is seen in application servers with very large thread pools, This is becoming more common in 64bit addressing JVMs running complex applications. WebSphere Application support recommends setting the ulimit -r ulimited on AIX.

The nproc limit usually only counts processes on a server towards determining this number. Linux systems running WebSphere Application Server are a particular case. The nproc limit on Linux counts the number of threads within all processes that can exist for a given user. To determine the ulimit settings of a WebSphere Application Server process running on Linux refer to "How to determine the ulimit settings of a running WebSphere Application Server process on Linux [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21407889]".

User Limits (in bytes except for NOFILE and NPROC) 

type soft limit hard limit RLIMIT_AS unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_CORE unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_CPU unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_DATA unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_FSIZE unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_LOCKS unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_MEMLOCK 65536 65536 RLIMIT_NOFILE 65536 65536 RLIMIT_NPROC 131072 131072 

For most cases of older versions of Linux this value will be defaulted to around 2048. For out of the box Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6 the default value for nproc will be set to 1024. This low default setting for larger systems will not allow for enough threads in all processes. 

WebSphere Application Server Support recommends setting the ulimit -u or nproc to a value of 131072 when running on Linux to safely account for all the forked threads within processes that could be created. 

By using this recommended value a sufficient number of threads in all processes will be allowed and will not be a limiting factor for the environment. Increasing the limit to the suggested value should have no negative impact. When the number of threads in all processes reaches the -u ulimit, an out of memory error message will be thrown. This issue can be avoided by increasing this limit. Be aware that if the number of threads/processes reaches the recommended number of 131072 or close, the issue may be deeper and continuing to increase the -u ulimit will only prove to be a temporary fix. 

Once the ulimit is increased, the WebSphere Application Server will need to be restarted to use the 
new setting. In the case of WebSphere Application Server ND, the nodeagent and the servers on the nodes will need to be restarted. 

 IBM Rewriting HTTP (port 80) requests to HTTPS (port 443) - United States rewrite; ssl; plugin; dynamic; static; rules; IHS; WAS TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The rewrite module (mod_rewrite.c) provided with the IBM® HTTP Server can be used as an effective way to automatically rewrite all HTTP requests to HTTPS. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The rewrite module (mod_rewrite.c) can be used to automatically rewrite all HTTP (port 80) requests to HTTPS (port 443). This provides an effective way to ensure that all traffic to and from the IBM HTTP Server is encrypted over the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) without having to use individual redirects or hard-coded HTTPS links. 
Note: The web server should already be configured to handle HTTPS requests successfully
before attempting to implement the following suggestions. For assistance with setting up SSL in the IBM HTTP Server, visit SSL guide [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21179559]

First, make sure the LoadModule line for mod_rewrite is uncommented in the httpd.conf

LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so

Next, add the following to the global scope or any port 80 VirtualHost stanzas defined within the httpd.conf configuration file.

RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{SERVER_PORT} =80
RewriteRule ^(.*) https://%{SERVER_NAME}%{REQUEST_URI} [R,L]

Finally, restart the IBM HTTP Server after making the preceding changes

Important: If using HTTP authentication, make sure it is only configured for your SSL virtual host. If it also applies to your port 80 requests, the authentication challenge can pre-empt the rewrite, resulting in user IDs and passwords being sent over an unencrypted session.

It is also recommended that you configure your port 80 virtual host with a different document root and so on, from your SSL virtual host. This is to be sure that even if your rewrite fails, sensitive information cannot be served from that virtual host over unencrypted sessions.

 IBM Does the RRT agent support TLS 1.1/1.2 and 256-bit ciphers? - United States 256-bit ciphers; Strong Encryption; TLS 1.1; TLS 1.2; SSL; Generic Failure; Cannot support; RPT; RRT; T6; 71RRT-RPTPLAN; 71RRT-RPTINS; 71RRT-RPTCONF; 71RRT-RPTPLAY; 71RRT-RPTWV; 71RRT-RPTTS TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What do you need to do to configure the Robotic Response Time (RRT) agent to support TLS 1.1/1.2 and 256-bit ciphers? 

CAUSE
Support for TLS 1.1/1.2 and 256-bit ciphers is determined by the underlying JRE (Java Runtime Environment). Consequently, in order to support TLS 1.1/1.2 and 256-bit ciphers, patch the RPT workbench JRE, and patch the RRT agent JRE. Both JREs must support the same level of TLS.

ANSWER
 

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are transport layer protocols. Ciphers implement security by providing the encryption mechanism. 

TLS is the new protocol. SSL protocol got up to version 3.0. In effect, TLS 1.0 is SSL 3.1. Currently, TLS versions include TLS 1.1 and 1.2. Each new version adds new features and modifies internal details. 

Whether the RRT agent supports TLS1.1/1.2 depends on whether the underlying JRE supports TLS 1.1/1.2. The JRE that supports the RRT agent and the JRE that supports RPT workbench must both support the same version of TLS and the same ciphers. 

For example, RRT 7.3 FP01 supports RPT 8.3.0.3, but RPT 8.3.0.3 does not support TLS1.1/1.2. Consequently, RRT 7.3 FP01 also does not support TLS 1.1/1.2.

In comparison, RRT 7.4 with IF21 or IF24 (7.4.0.0-TIV-CAMRT-IF0021 or 7.4.0.0-TIV-CAMRT-IF0024) can support RPT 8.3 and RPT 8.6 since RPT 8.6 supports TLS1.1 /1.2, and the IBM Java 7 included with RRT 7.4 also supports TLS 1.1/1.2. 

However, when a script uses TLS 1.2/1,2, some ciphers may not be supported. To verify whether certain cipher suites are supported, visit the IBM Java Knowledge Center:

IBM Java Cipher Suite Information
http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_7.0.0/com.ibm.java.security.component.70.doc/security-component/jsse2Docs/ciphersuites.html?lang=en [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_7.0.0/com.ibm.java.security.component.70.doc/security-component/jsse2Docs/ciphersuites.html?lang=en]


Do You Need to Patch Java?

First, determine whether your script uses 256-bit ciphers. In RPT workbench, open the script in Test Editor mode. In the left panel, drill down through the Server Access Configurations. Select SSL.

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21960133&amp;aid=1]

In the right panel, examine the available ciphers that display. If the list contains 256-bit ciphers, you need to support Strong Encryption in RPT and the RRT agent. The name identifies the encryption level. For example, SSL_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA is a 256-bit cipher. The presence of 256 in the cipher name means that the cipher supports 256-bit encryption. 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21960133&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21960133&aid=2]

Cipher Naming Conventions

In RPT workbench, the cipher name always begins with "SSL" to simplify naming conventions. If the script uses TLS as the protocol in the test, then the cipher is a TLS cipher.

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21960133&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21960133&aid=3]

Playback Symptoms

Check whether your script playbacks indicate that the RRT JRE needs to be patched to support Strong Encryption. Strong Encryption adds 256-bit ciphers.

1) The Playback Status workspace shows that playbacks are complete, but the Verification Failures workspace shows:

Patching JREs to Support TLS 1.1/1,2

By default, RPT workbench is configured with restricted or limited strength ciphers. To use less restricted encryption algorithms, you need to download and apply the unlimited jurisdiction policy files (local_policy.jar and US_export_policy.jar). 

See Enabling Strong encryption greater than 128 bit key lengths in Rational Performance Tester
http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21245273 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21245273]

Use the following instructions to patch the JRE that the RRT agent uses.

Note: Backup the jar files that these steps replace -- before you replace these files.

1) Go to the IBM developerWorks Java Technology Security page for JRE 6 security information. 
See https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/security/ [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/security/]

2) Click on the "Java SE 6" link. 

3) Click on the "IBM SDK Policy files".

4) On the Sign in page, enter your developerWorks IBM ID and password.

5) After successfully logging in, select Files for Java 5.0 SR16, Java 6 SR13, Java 6 SR5 (J9 VM2.6), Java 7 SR4, and all later releases. Click on Continue.

6) Scroll down to the License portion of the resulting page and click on the View license link to see the licensing terms for the download.

7) If the licensing terms are acceptable, check I agree and click on the I confirm link. If the terms are not acceptable, you are not able to enable strong encryption, and you should click I cancel.

8) Click on the Download now link to download the unrestricted.zip file.

9) Extract the local_policy.jar and US_export_policy.jar files from the unrestricted.zip archive.

10) Log onto the RRT agent host, and stop the RRT agent.

11) Backup the local_policy.jar and US_export_policy.jar files in the <ITM_HOME>/tmaitm6/java60/jre/lib/security and <ITM_HOME>/tmaitm6/java70/jre/lib/security directories on the RRT agent host.

12) Place those two files in the <ITM_HOME>/tmaitm6/java60/jre/lib/security and <ITM_HOME>/tmaitm6/java70/jre/lib/security directories on the RRT agent host. Replace the existing files with the same names. Verify that the file permissions are the same as the files you replaced.

13) Restart the RRT agent.

14) Try to playback the RPT script again. Does the script playback successfully, without error?

 IBM Using dblook and ij to work with the embedded Apache Derby in WebSphere Portal - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM WebSphere Portal 6.1 uses an embedded version of Apache Derby out of the box. However, there is no longer a graphical tool such as CloudView (as with Cloudscape 5.x). In order to obtain the data and structure of the WebSphere Portal database, dblook and ij utilities can be used to accomplish such goals. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM

Before proceeding with the following, it is strongly recommended that you back up your Derby database. Make a copy of <wp_profile>/PortalServer/derby/wpsdb to a backup directory. Since the version of Derby used in WebSphere Portal is embedded, you must stop the Portal server before you can access the database although you can always work on the backup copy.

NOTE: For simplicity, we will omit the extension of the utilities. You should add ".sh" or ".bat' depending on the platform.

There are three primary utility tools that are installed with WebSphere 6.1, "dblook", "ij", and "sysinfo", under the <was_root>/AppServer/derby/bin/embedded directory. The sysinfo utility generates information about the operating system, the Java version and classpath, and the Derby driver files and version information.

dblook utility
The dblook utility is used to view the database structure (in DDL - Data Definition Language) for a specific database. 

The usage is dblook -d <databaseURL> [options], where databaseURL is in the "jdbc:derby:<database>" format. The <database> should be given as a full path, such as C:\IBM\WebSphere\wp_profile\derby\wpsdb. 

Commonly used options include: 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Examples:
 * 
 * 
 * dblook -d jdbc:derby:C:\IBM\WebSphere\wp_profile\PortalServer\wpsdb -o C:\temp\wpsdb_ddl.sql
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * dblook -d jdbc:derby:C:\IBM\WebSphere\wp_profile\PortalServer\wpsdb -z release -o C:\temp\wpsdb_ddl.sql
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * dblook -d jdbc:derby:C:\IBM\WebSphere\wp_profile\PortalServer\wpsdb -z release -t user_desc -verbose -o C:\temp\user_desc.sql
 * 
 * 


ij utility 
The ij utility is a command line SQL processor. It can be used to run DDL for creating database, tables, indexes, and so on. In a WebSphere Portal environment, it would typically be used for exporting data or making simple changes (when advised by IBM Support). 

To start ij, simply open a command prompt or terminal window, change the directory and enter the command. You should then see the ij shell with prompt "ij>". 

The following are some common commands that you may use when reviewing data in the Portal database.  * 
 * ij> connect 'jdbc:derby:C:\IBM\WebSphere\wp_profile\derby\wpsdb';
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * ij> show connections;
 * 
 * 
 *  CONNECTION0* - jdbc:derby:C:\ibm\websphere\wp_profile\portalserver\derby\wpsdb 
   * = current connection 
   ij> driver "org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver'; 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * ij> set schema=release;
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * ij> select * from user_desc where oid=1000;
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * ij> run 'myquery.sql';
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * ij> CALL SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_EXPORT_TABLE('RELEASE','USER_DESC','USER_DESC.SQL',';','|',NULL);
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * ij> 
 * CALL SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_EXPORT_QUERY('SELECT * FROM RELEASE.USER_DESC','user_desc_query.sqlL',null,'|',NULL);
 * 
 *

 IBM Configuring DataPower MQ client to use SSL in mutual authentication mode - United States datapower; mq; websphere mq; ssl; mutual authentication mode; mq manager; 7993; 7993; 7993; machine type 7993 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The WebSphere DataPower MQ Client can be configured to use SSL in mutual authentication mode with a Remote WebSphere MQ Manager. This step-by-step technote guides DataPower Appliance users on how to configure DataPower MQ Manager Object to use SSL in mutual authentication mode. This technote assumes that MQ queue manager is configured with key database and its associted password file for using SSL connection with other MQ clients. If it is not configured yet, it has to be done first using the URL: http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.mq.explorer.doc/e_ssl.htm [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.mq.explorer.doc/e_ssl.htm] 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In order to use this technote, you should have a working knowledge of how to setup and administer MQ Server in Windows, AIX, Solaris, HP-UX, or Linux environment. You should also have an understanding of how to configure DataPower MQ Manager Object that connects to remote WebSphere MQ Queue Manager (qmgr). This technote focuses on configuring DataPower MQ Client to use SSL in mutual authentication mode with Firmware Releases 3.8.2 and later fixpacks. Follow these steps to configure DataPower MQ Manager Object (mq-qm object) to access WebSphere MQ Queue Manager (Remote MQ Server) in SSL mutual authentication mode.
WebSphere MQ configuration prerequisites

The following three steps are necessary to make sure that the SSL configurations for the Remote MQ Server is correctly working. Refer to IBM WebSphere MQ product manuals to configure MQ environment to work in SSL mutual authentication mode.


 1. Configure WebSphere MQ Queue Manager (Remote MQ Server) to use SSL authentication (SSLCAUTH as "required") using URL: http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.mq.explorer.doc/e_ssl.htm [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.mq.explorer.doc/e_ssl.htm]. 
 2. Configure WebSphere MQ Client to use SSL authentication. 
 3. Verify that WebSphere MQ Client can PUT/GET message(s) using application programs such as amqsputc and amqsgetc with MQ Queue Manager in SSL mutual authentication mode.
    


Generate self signed key/certificate 
 1. Generate the self signed key/certificate pair using the "crypto tool" from the DataPower device. 
 2.  Download the two files to your local machine. For the sake of illustration purpose, the names of the key and certificate files are defined as "dpmqclient-privkey.pem" and "dpmqclient-sscert.pem" respectively. 
 3. Assuming that openssl tool (www.openssl.org [http://www.openssl.org]) is installed in the local machine. With openssl tool, you can use the following command to create a "pkcs12" type key from the above key/certificate pair which are of PEM type. This step is necessary as MQ key database will not import key/certificate files created as PEM.
    
    openssl pkcs12 -export -out dpmqclient-key.p12-in dpmqclient-sscert.pem-inkey dpmqclient-privkey.pem-name ibmwebspheremqadmin
    
    Note the value associated with "-name" parameter. IBM WebSphereMQ client required a friendly label as "ibmwebspheremq<userid>" of the MQ client user. In this example, the user name is being used as "admin". This user must be used in the DataPower MQ Queue Manager object and it must also be an authorized user for both the DataPower MQ instance as well as for the remote WebSphere MQ Server. Please refer to Pages G58-62 in the 3.6.0-WebGui Guide for various fields as described in MQ Queue Manager configuration screen. Also note the following two fields with appropriate values which are required for the MQ Queue Manager object to connect the remote WebSphere MQ Server in SSL mode. 

 *  SSL Key Repository: The key database file name 
   SSL Cipher Specification: TRIPLE_DES_SHA_US 
   

To import a personal certificate using "iKeycmd" GUI, use the following commands in your host machine where the WebSphere MQ Server/Client is running. 
 * UNIX
 * 
 * 
 *  gsk7cmd -cert -import -file filename -pw password -type pkcs12 -target filename -target_pw password -target_type cms 
 * 
 * 
 * Windows
 * 
 * 
 *  runmqckm -cert -import -file filename -pw password -type pkcs12 -target filename -target_pw password -target_type cms 
 * 
 *

Generate the new password file 

Follow these steps to generate the new password file. 
 1.  Start the iKeyman GUI using either the gsk7ikm command (on UNIX) or the strmqikm command (on Windows). 
 2.  From the Key Database File menu, click Open. The Open window displays. 
 3.  Click Key database type and select CMS (Certificate Management System). 
 4.  Click Browse to navigate to the directory that contains the key database files. 
 5.  Select the key database file in which you want to save the certificate, for example key.kdb. 
 6.  Click Open. The Password Prompt window displays. 
 7.  Type the password you set when you created the key database and click OK. 
 8.  The name of your key database file displays in the File Name field. The Personal Certificates menu will display both "ibmwebspheremq<qmgr>" and "ibmwebspheremq<user>" labels. 
 9.  In the WebSphere MQ Certificate key database, there is one certificate assigned to the queue manager or client. The certificate's Friendly Name attribute contains the string ibmwebspheremq followed in lower case by the queue manager name or the client logon ID. This Friendly Name value becomes the label of the certificate in the GSKit key database. Refer to Alter the Friendly Name (Label) of pkcs12 certificates for importing into GSKit [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21225160] if you want to alter the Friendly Name (Label) of pkcs12 certificates that are part of WebSphere MQ Certificate key database. Refer to "Migrating SSL Security Certificates in WebSphere MQ for Windows" [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.mq.csqzas.doc/sy12430_.htm?resultof=%22%6d%71%22%20%22%66%69%78%22%20%22%6d%69%67%72%61%74%65%64%22%20%22%6d%69%67%72%61%74%22%20%22%63%65%72%74%69%66%69%63%61%74%65%73%22%20%22%63%65%72%74%69%66%22%20] if you want to fix the migrated certificates from the WebSphere MQ V5.3 version to later version. [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.mq.csqzao.doc/mi10240_.htm] 
 10. From the key database File menu, click Stash Password. This will create the new password file as "key.sth". Select OK and close the key database File. 
 11. Upload the "key.kdb" and "key.sth" files to "cert:" directory of the DataPower box. Configure the MQ client object in the DataPower box to use this key database as shown in the screen shot above to connect in SSL mutual authentication mode with the MQ Manager. The following screen shot shows the "key.kdb" and "key.sth" files are located in the "cert:" directory of the application domain.[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21260155&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21260155&aid=1] This screen shot below shows that mq-qm object is using the "key.kdb" file located in the "cert:" directory with the associated cipher specification as "TRIPLE_DES_SHA_US". Note that SSL Proxy Profile field is "(none)" as this configuration is using key repository method for SSL connection.[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21260155&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21260155&aid=2] 
 12. Refresh the SSL security attribute of the MQ Manager to use this key database and password files from the host machine running MQ Server.
     
     Runmqsc <MQ Manager>
     Refresh security type(ssl)
     End
     
 13. Test your application to PUT/GET MQ message(s) using DataPower MQ client with the new configuration.

Note: DataPower 3.8 and later firmware provides a separate method for the mq-qm object to use SSL in mutual authentication mode. This method uses DataPower SSL Proxy Profile that includes Crypto profile with Identification Credential. For more details, refer to DataPower InfoCenter on how to create SSL Proxy Profile:

 IBM How do I change the default 'fit content by' behaviour of Daeja viewer in IBM Content Navigator, to fit content by height or width? - United States fit by height; fit by width; fit; default fit; Daeja viewer; FileNet viewer; Daeja; scale TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I change the default 'fit content by' behaviour of Daeja viewer in IBM Content Navigator, to fit content by height or width? 

ANSWER
In Content Navigator v2.0.2 

In the ..navigator.war/applets/filenetViewer_properties.jsp file, set the value of the parameter 'scale' as follows 

To fit content by width, specify - scale: "ftow",
To fit content by height, specify - scale: "ftoh",

Here's another way to modify the behaviour: 

 * make the same changes above to the filenetViewer_properties.jsp under ECMClient\configure\explodedformat\navigator\applets folder. 
 * Rebuild and redeploy the ear file. 
 * Restart the application server


Save the changes and they should get picked up when the viewer is re-launched.  

In Content Navigator v2.0.3 

The same parameter-value pair mentioned above can be added in the Additional Settings section of the Daeja ViewONE panel, of the admin desktop. Add the parameter-value pair to the Additional Settings section of 

 * the Professional tab for modifying the behaviour of the Daeja Professional viewer 
 * the Virtual tab for modifying the behaviour of the Daeja Virtual viewer.


Click New in the Additional Settings section to add the parameter-value pair. Save the changes and they should get picked up when the viewer is re-launched.

 IBM How to export and import keys from an HSM-enabled IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I export and import private keys between the same or different Hardware Security Module (HSM) enabled IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance? 

ANSWER
HSM-enabled DataPower appliances support the export of private keys using the crypto-export command. For key export to work, various conditions must be met: 

 * HSMs must be initialized and in the same key sharing domain on exporting and importing machines 
 * The private key in question must be marked exportable at keygen time (see keygen's exportable option) 
 * HSMs on exporting and importing machines must share internal key-wrapping keys (see hsm-clone-kwk command). A key-wrapping key is a key that encrypts another key.


Each HSM has a special key inside of it, the key-wrapping key, that is used to encrypt exported private keys (and to decrypt imported private keys). If the goal is to restore exported keys to the same appliance, then you don't need to worry about hsm-clone-kwk, red keys, or the hsm-domain parameter. That is because the key-wrapping key at import time will already match the key-wrapping key at export time (since the HSM device is the same). If the goal is to move exported keys from one appliance to another one, then all of the steps in this section must be followed :- 

First, the two HSMs in question must be both be initialized and in the same key sharing domain. This means that they must both be initialized in the same mode (both in Security Level 2 or both in Security Level 3). In Security Level 2 mode, they must have used the same hsm-domain parameter during hsm-reinit (this parameter has a default value that is the same on all appliances). In Security Level 3 mode, they must have used the same red PED key during hsm-reinit (and the second initialization must not have overwritten the key value from the first initialization). 

Second, the key to be exported must be exportable. The exportability of keys is immutable. It is determined at keygen time, and it is controlled by that command's exportable parameter. If a key was created outside of the appliance (not using keygen), then it is always considered exportable. 

Finally, before the crypto-export crypto-import sequence, the key-wrapping keys must be synchronized using the hsm-clone-kwk command. This command must be run four times: once on the source HSM appliance (with the key-wrapping key you are copying), once on the destination HSM appliance, once again on the source HSM appliance, and once again on the destination HSM appliance. Each time the command is run, it will need the output file from the previous step (as the input to the current step) which must be moved manually (usually with the copy command). 

Once all of this has been done, then private keys may move from system to system with crypto-export and crypto-import. 

Note that the non-HSM appliance can export keys immediately at keygen time, but never at a later time. 

For additional information refer to the online Info Center [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wsdatap/v3r8m2/index.jsp?topic=%2Fxi50%2Fwelcome.htm] and search for "PIN entry device".

 IBM 'EJPDB0160E: The sanity checks of the database layer failed' error occurs during startup after successful database transfer - United States EJPDB0160E: The sanity checks of the database layer failed. EJPDB0160E TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After receiving a 'Build Successful' message during a database transfer for IBM® WebSphere® Portal, you attempt to start WebSphere_Portal and receives this error message, "EJPDB0160E: The sanity checks of the database layer failed". 

SYMPTOM
The entire error message and stack trace will appear like this in the SystemOut.log:

======================================================================================


CAUSE
The database was not created using UTF-8 character encoding. 


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
On an Oracle® environment you can run these SQL statements to determine the character sets: 



SELECT VALUE FROM NLS_DATABASE_PARAMETERS WHERE PARAMETER IN ('NLS_CHARACTERSET', 'NLS_NCHAR_CHARACTERSET'); 
SELECT PROPERTY_VALUE FROM DATABASE_PROPERTIES WHERE PROPERTY_NAME IN 
('NLS_CHARACTERSET', 'NLS_NCHAR_CHARACTERSET'); 

In this case the customer had these results for both SQL statements:

============================= 
PROPERTY_VALUE 
------------- 
WE8ISO8859P1 
AL16UTF16 
=============================

If the database character sets had been setup correctly then both lines would have read "AL16UTF16". In this case NLS_CHARACTERSET returns "WE8ISO8859P1" which is not a supported format. If the database had been setup correctly both lines would have produced "AL16UTF16". 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
At this point there is no way to salvage the database in its current state. The entire Portal database must be dropped and recreated using the specifications provided in the InfoCenter at this link: 


http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wpdoc/v6r1m0/topic/com.ibm.wp.e [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wpdoc/v6r1m0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.wp.ent.doc/config/aix_oracle_create_db.html]

This is the specific information in the Information Center pertaining to character encoding:

=============================

All databases must be created using UNICODE Database and National character sets such as UTF8, AL32UTF8, or AL16UTF16.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You can process a core dump with Jextract, as long as the dump itself was produced by the IBM WebSphere Application Server JVM and is processed on the same system as the dump. 

A processed dump can be used in both the Eclipse Memory Analyzer Tool [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/tools/mat.html] and the DTFJ Dump Analyzer [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/tools/dumpanalyzer/]. Both are included as downloadable tools from within IBM Support Assistant Workbench [http://www.ibm.com/software/support/isa/]. 




Locating the Core Dump 

For WebSphere Application Server installations, the default location for the core dumps is in the profile's root directory: <WAS_HOME>/profiles/<PROFILE_NAME>/ 

The file extension will usually be *.dmp, but on some versions of AIX and Linux, the file may simply be named core. The process id and the date stamp are normally appended to the name of the file. 




Processing the Dump 

Execute the jextract command on the same system and installation of WebSphere Application Server that the core dump was produced on. If you don't use the full path on AIX or Linux, make sure to use ./jextract (including the dot-slash) so the correct executable is picked up. 

Replace [COREDUMP_PATH] with the full path plus filename of the core dump produced. 

 

If you do not know if compressed references is enabled, scroll to the FAQ section for a brief explanation. 

 

Determining the Java Directory 

Because different profiles on WebSphere Application Server 8.5.5.X and later can use different SDKs, the java directory inside the installation folder can differ. To determine the path, check the process list for the application server process and see which folder the java executable is being launched from. 

 

NOTE: If you are on WebSphere Liberty and are using an IBM SDK, the entire path to that SDK will differ. 

 




32-bit JVM and
64-bit JVM with Compressed References disabled
AIX/Linux: 
<WAS_HOME>/<JAVA_DIR>/jre/bin/jextract [COREDUMP_PATH]

Windows: 
<WAS_HOME>\<JAVA_DIR>\jre\bin\jextract.exe [COREDUMP_PATH]




64-bit JVM with Compressed References enabled
Does not apply to WebSphere Application Server 6.1
AIX/Linux: 
<WAS_HOME>/<JAVA_DIR>/jre/bin/jextract -J-Xcompressedrefs [COREDUMP_PATH]

Windows: 
<WAS_HOME>\<JAVA_DIR>\jre\bin\jextract.exe -J-Xcompressedrefs [COREDUMP_PATH] 

 




Max Heap Size 

To adjust the max heap size, you can add -J-Xmx to adjust the size. For example, -J-Xmx1024m allows for a max heap size of 1024 MB when jextract is run. 

 

 




Files Generated 

The output will determine where the compressed data is stored (usually a .zip extension, .sdff is seen on older environments). Check the location of the core dump as that will be the most common location. 

Core files are usually compressible since a lot of data is zero; 10x compression can be expected in the resulting zip file 

 

If you find XML files in the output directory, this may mean jextract failed, as these files are supposed to be placed automatically within the SDFF or ZIP file. 

 




Error Messages 

EyeCatcher Error
Unable to find J9VMRAS eyecatcher
Error. Internal failure detected during jextract 

This error message indicates that jextract failed to identify the dump. This could be due to a number of things, including 

* The dump was not produced by WebSphere Application Server
* The dump was produced from a native library or component such as a JNI component or database driver.
* (AIX only) The dump generated is in an incompatible dump format due to an AIX OS issue (see APAR IZ88097 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IZ88097] for more details). 

 

Out of Memory Error 

Sometimes the core dump is much larger than the default heap size can manage, and the recommendation is to increase the heap size using the -J-Xmx option. 

 




FAQ 

How do I determine if compressed references is enabled? 

Compressed references were first introduced in 64-bit builds of IBM SDK 6.0. If WebSphere Application Server is at version 7.0.0.3 or higher, it will be enabled by default; see APAR PK75174 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK75174]. 

Checking the JVM arguments in the admin console can verify if compressed references was enabled manually. However, it's best to check the ps output or the javacore for the argument -Xcompressedrefs 

If you find the argument -Xnocompressedrefs has been added, this means it's disabled (see page 7 of this document [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/webserver/appserv/was/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf] for more info)) 

 

What happens to jextract if I cannot determine if compressed references was enabled? 

If you run jextract and did not realize compressed references was enabled, the output will ask you to rerun jextract and add the following argument: -J-Xcompressedrefs

 IBM UDX compilation error - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

THIS DOCUMENT APPLIES ONLY TO THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGE VERSION(S):
 English 

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Following error can be met during UDX compilation.
Can't exec "/nz/kit/bin/adm/nzudxcompile": Argument list too long 

SYMPTOM
nzudxcompile command returns an "Argument list too long" error and aborts.


CAUSE
ARG_MAX configuration parameter limits the number of argument list in command line. In this case the client used more than 131072 argument with many program *.c files.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check ARG_MAX value in the command line: 

$ getconf ARG_MAX
131072


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This ARG_MAX kernel parameter adjusted to much larger from kernel release version 2.6.23, that is 2621440 (http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/argmax [http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/argmax]). 

But we support upto Redhat 5.11 in Twinfin which is less than kernel release 2.6.23. So we have no way to allow ARG_MAX larger than 131072 at this time. 

 IBM When and how to apply a modification or fix pack - United States fix pack update bug correction APAR TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 When and how should I apply a modification or fix pack to my JRules or Operational Decision Management (WODM/ODM) installation?


CAUSE
The Operational Decision Manager version numbers use the standard IBM formatV.R.M.Fwhich stands for Version.Release.Modification.Fixpack. See the V.R.M.F Maintenance Stream Delivery Vehicle terminology explanation [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27008656] for more details. 


Modification and fix pack numbers are the third and fourth digits in the IBM product version number, for example: 8.5.M.F. 


Modification and fix packs include only bug fixes, so they do not affect the product functionality or your data.


See the following technotes to find out which update your installation need:


 * Finding the version of ODM product and fixes [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21627850] to determine the exact product versions that are installed on your machine.
   
 * Find the version of ODM components [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21400738] to determine the exact module or library versions that are deployed on your servers.
   
 * Operational Decision Manager Download document [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24031636] to learn about the latest modification or fix pack that is available for your product version. 
   
 * IBM Operational Decision Manager detailed system requirements [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27023067] to verify that your configuration is supported with your current product version.
   
 * IBM Support Lifecycle [http://www.ibm.com/software/websphere/support/lifecycle/] to verify that your current version does not reach end of support in the near future.



Referring to the last two documents above, you may find out that you need to migrate to the latest product version to ensure continued support of your applications. In that case, refer to technote Migrating to the latest version of Operational Decision Management [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21589725]. 

That being said, make sure to consider migrating to the latest version or release ( V.R.M.F) of the product as soon as possible to benefit from the latest added features and improvements. 
ANSWER
As with any software product, even if you do not have any issues with running your current configuration, you should apply the latest modification or fix pack to take advantage of these benefits: 

 * Anticipate and avoid the risk of encountering defects already fixed. 
 * Apply the latest product improvements that are available (performance, for example). 
 * Maintain a serviceable system and be able to install an interim fix when required.



WHEN TO UPDATE
The latest modification or fix pack should be installed as soon as it is available. 

You can subscribe to the IBM Support My Notifications [https://www.ibm.com/support/mynotifications] to be notified of any fix pack releases, and you can also bookmark the Operational Decision Manager Download document [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24031636] page, which lists the latest modifications or fix packs. 

See the technote Fix pack release notification for Operational Decision Manager [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21665593] to find out when a modification or fix pack will be available.






BEFORE UPDATING


The databases used in the sample server are deleted and recreated during the update. If you are using those databases and want to save the existing content, perform the following steps before updating: 
 *  Stop the sample server. In the folder <ODM_HOME>/shared/data/derby, create an archive file containing the resdb and rtsdb folders. Save the archive file, such as zip file, in the data folder. After installation, unzip the archive file in the folder <ODM_HOME>/shared/data/derby to restore your databases before restarting the sample server. 



A new profile is also created for the sample server, at the first server start following the installation of a modification or fix pack. 

If you want to continue using the same ports, you must delete the existing profile prior. In the <ODM_HOME>/shared/bin folder, from the command line, run the command ../tools/ant/bin/ant forcedestroyprofile. 


Note: The sample server is not designed to be used in a production system. For a production system, you must create a dedicated profile and database that you update using the following steps. 




UPDATING


Each modification or fix pack page provides instructions on how to download and run the installer, in addition to providing a list of corrections that are included in the update. 

The fix pack installation updates the following files and folders:  * JAR libraries in the installation directories, including <ODMInstallDir>\<Module>\lib. 
 * EAR and WAR applications in the <ODMInstallDir>\<Module>\applicationservers\<App Server> folders.


Once this is done, you perform these tasks:  * Repackage your client applications with the up-to-date libraries. 
 * Reapply product customizations to the up-to-date Java EE modules (EARs and WARs).



Note that all customizations you developed before the update, for example modifications of the descriptors, must be reapplied to the new, up-to-date EARs and WARs. It is a good idea to document and automate those customizations using scripts to make the process easier and error-proof. 

Finally, you must update the client applications and ODM modules on your server or servers with the same settings as you deployed previously. If you redeploy the application, follow again the documentation instructions to deploy all ODM modules to your servers [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r5m1/topic/com.ibm.odm.distrib.config/topics/odm_distrib_config.html]. 

Keep in mind that applying a modification or a fix pack does not require any data migration, so your projects and database remain the same. 

UPDATING RULE EXECUTION SERVER


Update the following applications in the application server:  *  jrules-res-xu-<server>.rar jrules-res-management-<server>.ear jrules-ssp-<server>.ear jrules-res-htds-<server>ear 


Make sure you do not change the class loading policies for applications and modules ( parent last for all ODM modules). 

Note: Updating the eXecution Unit RAR file requires a restart of the server. 


UPDATE DECISION CENTER


Update the following application in your application server: 
 * jrules-teamserver-<server>.ear


Make sure you do not change the class loading policies for applications and modules ( parent last for all ODM modules). 

UPDATE THE EVENTS RUNTIME

 1. Stop the event runtime application, wberuntimeear. 
 2. Uninstall the following applications, if they exist:  * wbefileconnector 
     * wbehttpconnector 
     * wbejdbcconnector 
     * wbejmsconnector 
     * wbesoapconnector
    
    
 3. Update the application wberuntimeear. 
 4. Start the application wberuntimeear.


Make sure you do not change the class loading policies for applications and modules ( parent last for all ODM modules). 




ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
 * Again, in addition to applying the latest modification or fix pack, consider migrating to the latest version or release (V.R.M.F) of the product as soon as possible to benefit from recently added features and improvements. See our technote Migrating to the latest version of Operational Decision Management [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21589725] for more information. 
 * For JRules 7.1, you can refer to the JRules 7.1 list of fix packs [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27019787] and also Upgrading JRules to the latest V7.1 fix pack [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21474292] to learn how to apply the fix packs. But note that JRules 7.1 reaches end of support in September 2015 (see the IBM Support Lifecycle [http://www.ibm.com/software/websphere/support/lifecycle/] page). To ensure continued product support, plan an upgrade to the latest product version before that date.

 IBM Java SDK Upgrade Policy for the IBM WebSphere Application Server - United States upgrade policy TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What is the Java™ SDK upgrade policy for the IBM® WebSphere® Application Server? 

CAUSE
Updating to the latest compatible Java SDK could help you resolve problems more quickly.

ANSWER
The IBM WebSphere Application Server Java SDK can be upgraded to the latest service release for the same Java SDK version. 

List of WebSphere Application Server fix packs and the corresponding Java SDK versions [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg27005002]

Policy Summary by WebSphere Application Server release:

WebSphere Application Server V8.0, V8.5, V8.5.5
Starting with V8.0 and applicable to all subsequent releases and fixpacks, there is one install package that contains updates for both WebSphere Application Server and Java SDK. Applying fixpacks of WebSphere Application Server also upgrades the SDK that is packaged and bundled within the fixpack. Additionally, separate Java SDK fixpacks are also available that contain just the SDK updates which can be applied to upgrade the SDK.

WebSphere Application Server V7.0
Any V7.0 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.6.0 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.

WebSphere Application Server V6.1
Any V6.1 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.5.0 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.

WebSphere Application Server V6.0
Any V6.0 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.4.2 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.

WebSphere Application Server V5.1
Any V5.1 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.4.1 and any V5.1.1 can be upgraded to the latest Java SDK 1.4.2 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.

WebSphere Application Server V5.0
Any V5.0 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.3.1 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.



Details of Java SDK Upgrade Policy

WebSphere Application Server leverages the Java SDK as a base component. This results in unique support issues, including:


 * Matching Java SDK service releases to Application Server releases and fix packs
   
   
 * Delivering updates and fixes associated with the Java SDK on any given Application Server release.


In an effort to resolve customer Java SDK situations as quickly as possible, WebSphere Application Server Support has done a quickest-path-to-resolution analysis, determining the most direct way to collect problem information. 

In some cases, problem resolution might include finding shortcuts to resolve symptoms. One shortcut is an immediate upgrade to a newer compatible Java SDK service release, before gathering detailed problem determination data. 

There are multiple advantages to performing an immediate Java SDK upgrade as a quicker path to resolution over a full Problem Determination (PD) process: 
 1. There is a continuous stream of fixes going into the Java SDK. Many problems encountered by customers are resolved by these fixes.
    
    
 2. When a new problem is encountered, applying the latest Java SDK is a quick way to determine if related fixes change the symptoms or correct the problem.
    
    
 3. Many documented Java SDK fixes have common symptoms. Frequently, limited PD data does not isolate the problem to a single root cause.
    


These factors highlight the advantage of applying a newer Java SDK before working through a full PD cycle. 

Java SDK and WebSphere Application Server software are updated frequently. To avoid compatibility issues for customers, WebSphere Application Server Support maintains this Java SDK Upgrade Policy. 

WebSphere Application Server Support details: 
http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/support.html [http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/support.html] 

Identifying compatibility limitations between WebSphere Application Server releases and Java SDK service releases that have not been tested together reduces risk. 

Important: Using a Java SDK not specifically packaged with WebSphere Application Server and supplied by IBM, or in violation of the Java SDK Upgrade Policy, is not supported by IBM WebSphere Application Server Support for Java SDK problems. RELATED INFORMATION

 IBM Distribute Decision Validation Service tests on different Rule Execution Server instances - United States SSPResolver; SSP TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Can I configure Rules Team Server to distribute the Decision Validation Service tests to multiple application servers? 

CAUSE
With a Rule Execution Server environment defined on a domain with multiple servers it is possible to define which Rule Execution Server instances will be used to execute the Rule Team Server Decision Services

ANSWER
First remember to pack all your XOMs (eXecutable Object Model) into the ssp.war following the documentation [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc/Content/Business_Rules/Documentation/_pubskel/JRules/ps_JRules_Global720.html]. 

Then make sure the SSP (ssp.war) is deployed on each server along with a XU connection factory and the appropriate datasource definition. 

 

Then create your own SSP resolver, add it to the teamserver.war and set the teamserver.defaultSSPResolver.class property to this class following this specification [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc/html/api/html/ilog/rules/teamserver/model/testing/IlrSSPResolver.html]. 

 

By implementing your own method IlrSSPResolver.getSSPURL(String serverName,URL url), you will be able to point to something else than the default provider. 

The default provider uses the url of the Rule Execution Server passed in parameter and replaces the application name with testing. 

A simple implementation can use the server name to return a specific server URL. 

for example you can have 2 servers defined in RTS: 

 * testingServer1 http://host1:9080/res 
 * testingServer2 http://host1:9080/res


And your SSP provider can evaluate the SSP URL as follow : 
if ( serverName.equals("testingServer1") )
{
return ( new URL( "http://server1:9080/testing" ) );
}
else if ( serverName.equals("testingServer2") )
{
return ( new URL( "http://server2:9080/testing" );
}
else 
return( new URL( "http://host1:9080/testing" )); 

 

Then when running a DVS test the execution will be dispatched according to the server you choose. 

 

For a more elaborate implementation you can have a dependency with the project being tested so that you can distribute the DVS execution based on a project: 


ManagerBean bean = ManagerBean.getInstance() ; 
IlrSession session = bean.getSession(); 
IlrRuleProject project = session.getWorkingBaseline().getProject();
String pname = project.getName(); 

.

 IBM WSDL Cache Policy not refreshing from WSDL in local:/// directory - United States datapower; wsdl cache refresh; wsdl; cache; refresh TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You created a Web Service Proxy (WS Proxy) based on a .wsdl file and want to refresh when there are changes in the .wsdl file. The file is located on the DataPower appliance under the "local" directory. You created a WSDL Cache Policy to specify the local .wsdl file for the URL Match expression, but the web service proxy state is not being refreshed when there are changes in the file. 

SYMPTOM
The WSDL Cache Policy is not refreshing from a WSDL in the local:/// directory.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In a WS Proxy, you can refresh WSDL from an URL using WSDL Cache policy. However, if the WSDL is hosted on the DataPower appliance, such as in local:///, rather than on an external URL, the WSDL Cache Policy does not apply. 

For instance, changes made to local:///test.wsdl are not picked up by WS Proxy although there is a WSDL Cache policy setting the URL Match expression to local:///test.wsdl. 

This issue was reported to Quality Engineering but it was determined that the DataPower device is working as designed. The device will not poll WSDL files on the local store.

The WSDL Cache policy works with WSDL files hosted on an external URL.

To refresh a WSDL in the local:/// directory, disable and re-enable the service. 

 IBM Upgrade Rational Application Developer 9.6 to use Websphere Application Server ILAN - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Customers see different content in the Rational Application Developer (RAD) Websphere Application Server (WAS) download compared to prior RAD releases.

During install of this new WAS ILAN version, customers now see explicit wording saying this a no cost, non-supported and non-warranted version of WebSphere Application Server traditional. While this has always been the case for this developer version, refer to evaluation software page & FAQ below, seeing these words during install may be a new information for some users.


CAUSE
New WAS packaged in RAD: 

Rational Application Developer for WebSphere packages WebSphere Application Server for development and test purposes. WAS recently renamed WAS for Developers (WAS4D) to WAS ILAN (see here [https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/#asset/WAS_traditional_for_Developers]). In response to this change, RAD 9.6 now packages WAS ILAN available in the RAD_WS_9.6_WASTE_9.0.zip file. It has the same capabilities and updates that RAD users expect. 

Support for this new WAS packaged in RAD:
New message during installation has worried users, however, users with an active support contract for their production WebSphere Application Server are entitled for support on the developer machine as long as an active support contract is in place for the production server.

To change/upgrade RAD 9.6 WAS4D to WAS ILAN. 

Add the following repository to Installation Manager: https://www.ibm.com/software/repositorymanager/com.ibm.websphere.ILAN.v90/ [https://www.ibm.com/software/repositorymanager/com.ibm.websphere.ILAN.v90/] 

 IBM Obtaining debug information during Decision Warehouse trace capture - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How can I obtain debug information when the trace is saved to the Decision Warehouse ? 

CAUSE
To minimize the impact of Decision Warehouse (DW) monitoring on the processing of ruleset executions, possible failures to save the trace to the database may remain silent (no stack trace in the logs of the application server). 

ANSWER
If an issue arises during DW trace persistence at runtime, the related messages and stack traces are only available programmatically through the following API: ilog.rules.res.session.IlrSessionResponse.getWarnings() 

So it is possible for an error to remain silent if the warnings above are not explicitly logged by the application. 

It is however possible to customize the DW trace and log additional debug information even when the application does not explicitly log the above mentioned warnings. The attached sample uses the java.util.logging API to append to the ilog.rules.support.debugtrace.DebugTraceDAO logger the following: 

 * at SEVERE level any exception that occurred while attempting to persist the trace to the database 
 * at INFO level a summary of the trace with ruleset path information and a list of execution events 
 * at FINEST level the list of session response warnings and the full execution trace XML (beware this can be a very large amount of information going to the log, possibly several megabytes)


By default only INFO level and above messages (including SEVERE) are typically visible in the application server logs. So the first two set of information above should be visible, while the FINEST level should require specific configuration of the Java logging to be visible. 

Instructions 

Bundle the attached jrules-debugtrace.jar sample in the Rule Execution Server (RES) application that is performing ruleset executions:  * If you are using JRules Hosted Transparent Decision Service (HTDS), in jrules-res-htds-<appserver>.ear/jrules-res-htds-<appserver>.war/WEB-INF/lib 
 * If you are using JRules Scenario Service Provider (SSP) in jrules-ssp-<appserver>.ear/jrules-ssp-server.war/WEB-INF/lib 
 * If you are executing rules from your application, the sample should be packaged alongside the RES session library that your application already bundles

 IBM Batches left in running state by Rulerunner with IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture - United States rule runner; batches; multiple; running TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When running batch creation tasks, such as VScan, with Rulerunner, multiple batches may be created and/or left in the running state. 

CAUSE
Rulerunner is a very efficient service and will overdrive the Rulerunner Server if too many tasks or threads are assigned.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Turn off Mixed Queuing 

 1. Run Rulerunner Manager. 
 2. On the Rulerunner tab, stop the service. 
 3. On the Rulerunner Login tab, click Connect. 
 4. Select the Workflow tab. 
 5. On the Rulerunner Settings subtab, uncheck Mixed Queuing. 
 6. Click Save, then go back to the Rulerunner tab and start the service.


Set skipsamebatch for VScan tasks  1. Run Rulerunner Manager. 
 2. On the Rulerunner tab, stop the service. 
 3. On the Rulerunner Login tab, click Connect. 
 4. On the Workflow tab, expand the hierarchy on the right and highlight VScan. 
 5. In the Settings section in the lower right, set skipsamebatch to 1. 
 6. Highlight the line labeled <dbs> above VScan in the thread hierarchy. 
 7. Set skipsamebatch to 1 there also. 
 8. Click Save, then go back to the Rulerunner tab and start the service.


For Datacap Taskmaster 8.0.1, the procedures are the same but some tabs will have different names. 

If you are still experiencing this issue the problem may be with your DataCap Object (DCO). Correcting DCO issues will resolve batches left in running state. RELATED INFORMATION

 IBM JRules or ODM module fails to access database with StaleConnectionException - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 JRules and ODM modules such as Rule Execution Server (RES) and Rule Team Server (RTS) / Decision Center (DC) may fail to access their data source with the following type of exception present in the log:

com.ibm.websphere.ce.cm.StaleConnectionException: Io exception: Connection timed out 

SYMPTOM
The problem may occur when a JRules or ODM module accesses its data source after a period of database access inactivity. For example: 

 * The first user accessing a RTS / DC server that remained idle overnight experiences a failure upon logging and the server log shows an com.ibm.websphere.ce.cm.StaleConnectionException occurred at that time. 
 * After a RES server has been processing execution requests normally for some time, an attempt to deploy a ruleset update fails and the server log shows an com.ibm.websphere.ce.cm.StaleConnectionException occurred upon an attempt to invalidate a ruleset or to retrieve its definition.


CAUSE
The underlying network connection for a data source is no longer valid although the data source itself remains considered active from the WebSphere Application Server data source connection pool management perspective. An attempt by a JRules module to try and access its data base through one such data source connection provided by the Application Server may then fail. 
The network connection of a data source may become invalid for a number of reasons, one typical example is that a firewall between the Application Server and the Database has a policy to discard network connections that remain idle for some time.


ENVIRONMENT
The exception com.ibm.websphere.ce.cm.StaleConnectionException is specific to WebSphere Application Server environments. But a similar issue can be experienced with Weblogic, see: Rule Execution Server on WebLogic unable to load ruleset after period of inactivity [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21615801]



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Configure the WebSphere Application Server data source connection pool [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/info/ae/ae/udat_conpoolset.html] so as to eliminate occurrences of StaleConnectionException : 

 * Set the Minimum connections to 0 to avoid situations where a connection is kept in the pool to meet the minimum requirement, even though it may have been idle for longer than Unused timeout 
 * Set the values for Unused timeout and Reap timeout so that the sum does not exceed any network level idle connection timeout

 IBM Content Navigator v2.0.3 is adding a .dat extension to a CSV file during Download action on a document. - United States icn; csv; download; mimetype; mime type TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM Content Navigator v2.0.3 is adding a .dat extension to a CSV document during Download action on the document. 

SYMPTOM
A .dat extension is added to the CSV document upon download.


CAUSE
A CSV document is basically a plain text file. If the mime type of the document as shown in system properties in ICN is not text/csv, then Navigator cannot recognize the document and a .dat extension will be added upon download. The correct mime type for a CSV file is text/csv. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If there are CSV document already in the content repository with a mime type that is not text/csv, then in order to view them in a text editor (ex. Notepad), you may use the following workaround:
- save the document to the local machine with .dat extension
- right click on the .dat file and click Open With... 
- click 'Choose your default program...'
- then select Notepad or another text editor of your choice
- select the checkbox 'Always use the selected program to open this type of file'

The other alternative is to change the mimetype of the document in the content repository using a custom solution written using the repository's client APIs. 

 IBM DataPower off-device logging: a configuration example - United States datapower; 7993; machine type 7993; logging; off device; off device logging; log target; off-device; syslog; debug log level; debug; log level TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote gives an example of how to enable off-device logging on an IBM® WebSphere® DataPower® appliance. This can be very helpful when a debug log level is needed to help isolate a problem or monitor behavior over a long period of time or can be used in production environment as DataPower only keeps a limited number of log files (the default is 3 files) in the file system in a rotational basis. 

CAUSE
The DataPower device has a finite amount of space to hold larger than average log files or long term logging needs in production environment. 

It should be noted that if used while debugging at load or in a capacity issue, log events may be dropped. There is a prioritization of events within the device and client traffic always comes first. Log events dropped can be confirmed or counted from the Status>Log Targets menu in the WebGUI.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Configure a server daemon to listen and capture the DataPower devices events. First, this example shows how to create the log target sending events to a syslog destination. The other examples listed below will have their own strong points to be considered depending on the problem scenario. 

 

Syslog: 

* The syslog protocol operates over UDP which has no guarantee on packet delivery - a fast fire and forget method. 

To create the new log target, go into the default domain: Objects > Log Targets 

Configure the log target with settings as follows from the WebGUI: 

 1. Name the log target 
 2. Select Target Type of syslog 
 3. Fill in the Local Identifier with a descriptive string that may be used by a remote recipient to identify this specific log target 
 4. Enter the Remote Host Address and the Remote IP Port as in the screen shot wherex.x.x.x is the IP address of the remote syslog server that listens on port 514 
 5. Take all other defaults



[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=1]  

 

Under the Event Subscriptions tab, you can select all and debug as indicated here: 


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=2] 

 * 
 * 6. Generate log events in the DataPower by using some transactions, for example by saving the configuration from the WebGUI or running some test load into a domain.


Syslog-ng, will simply work over the TCP protocol to ensure the packet is delivered to the destination. The same consideration should be applied to a device under high load in that a log event could be dropped if not able to be wrote out to the network within time. 

 

NFS:
All NFS limitations apply from file size and permission settings. This is a more common approach using an NFS static mount to capture a log target and can allow for slightly more reliable messages to be logged. The limiting factor again is the speed of the network and NFS server response time. 

 

File type: 

Using a file type log target with a backup method as seen here:
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=3]
This will allow log events to quickly be written to a local file on the device's file system. Once the file reaches its set size a connection to the destination will upload the file from the device. This will upload with a unique time and date stamp on the uploaded file.

This is a useful method to capture sporadic problems. This is also useful for long running transactions that may span more than one file depending on device load.


HTTP service:
Finally a clever method that may be used in some senarios would be an HTTP service on the device.
Using an HTTP service configured in the following way,
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=4] 

Once the file type log is created in the logtemp:/// directory, a client browser or wget type client can easily retrieve the file from the device. 

This is very useful when there is no local or accessible remote log storage location to the device, due to firewall or network restrictions. 

This is also removing the limitation of the device dropping the log event should it not be able to write the log event to the network. 

Each of the above methods are very useful and work better in some scenarios than others depending on the network, load, problem, and information needed. This is intended to be a guide to help you decide which method would be best for your scenario.

Health Center can save the data obtained from monitoring an application and load it again for analysis at a later date. 
   
   Starting with IBM Java 5 SR8 or IBM Java 6 SR1, The Health Center client can be installed within the IBM Support Assistant Team Server [http://www.ibm.com/software/support/isa/teamserver.html].
   
   The Health Center client has several different views, each reporting data regarding a different aspect of the JVM. The views available are: 
   
   
    *  Classes: Information about classes being loaded CPU: Processor usage for the application and the system on which it is running Environment: Details of the configuration and system of the monitored application Garbage Collection: Information about the Java heap and pause times I/O: Information about I/O activities that take place Locking: Information about contention on inflated locks Method Trace: Information about method use over time Native Memory: Information about the native memory usage Profiling: Provides a sampling profile of Java methods including call paths Threads: Information about the live threads of the monitored JVM WebSphere® Real Time for Linux: Information about real-time applications 
   
   
   
   To Install Health Center: 
   Health Center Client is installed as a plug-in for IBM Support Assistant (ISA), therefore, ISA must be installed prior to obtaining the Java Health Center.

 IBM Rule Team Server/Decision Center is timing out while performing certain operations - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How to resolve "Transaction timed out after 601 seconds" error while performing certain operations in Rule Team Server (RTS)/Decision Center (DC)? 

SYMPTOM
While generating ruleapps in RTS/DC, the following error is thrown after a few minutes (typically 5 or 10 minutes): 

On WebLogic: 

Rule Team Server has encountered an unexpected error. The internal error message is: #{SelectionBean.asynchAction}: javax.faces.el.EvaluationException: java.lang.RuntimeException: java.sql.SQLException: The transaction is no longer active - status: 'Marked rollback. [Reason=weblogic.transaction.internal.TimedOutException: Transaction timed out after 601 seconds BEA1-5057DF8C316E1C1224CD]'. No further JDBC access is allowed within this transaction. 

... 

 

On WebSphere: 
TimeoutManage I WTRN0006W: Transaction XXX has timed out after 300 seconds.
TimeoutManage I WTRN0124I: When the timeout occurred the thread with which the transaction is, or was most recently, associated was Thread[WebContainer : 3,5,main]. The stack trace of this thread when the timeout occurred was: 
ilog.rules.brl.parsing.parser.earley.IlrEarleyParser.errorRecovery(IlrEarleyParser.java:1046)
ilog.rules.brl.parsing.parser.earley.IlrEarleyParser.buildCharts(IlrEarleyParser.java:772)
ilog.rules.brl.parsing.parser.earley.IlrEarleyParser.parse(IlrEarleyParser.java:511)
...


CAUSE
The transaction timeout for RTS/DC is set to 10 minutes by default in the teamserver web module deployment descriptor (WEB-INF/web.xml), and application servers also have container level transaction timeouts that are configurable. If a transactional operation performed by RTS/DC takes longer than these timeouts to complete, the transaction is rolled back and the operation is not completed.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If you perform time consuming operations in large repositories, you can increase the timeout value in the web.xml file of the RTS/DC EAR file (jrules-teamserver-<appserver>.ear\teamserver.war\WEB-INF) by changing the value of the property ilog.rules.teamserver.transaction.timeout. 


You will find the property in the file web.xml defined as below:
...
<context-param>
<description>Modify the timeout value that is associated with transactions (in seconds)</description>
<param-name>ilog.rules.teamserver.transaction.timeout</param-name>
<param-value>600</param-value>
</context-param> 
... 

Another place to look for are application server specific transaction timeout configurations. For example, for WebSphere Application Server, check the "Maximum transaction timeout" and increase it as needed as described here [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/info/ae/ae/tjta_settlog.html].

 IBM web server Plugin may need LD_LIBRARY_PATH when used with Apache 2.2 - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM web server Plug-in provides the connection between the web server tier and the IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS) tier.

When using Apache 2.2 web server on Linux operating systems, the IBM web server Plug-in may need to have the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable set in a certain way, in order to be able to locate the IBM Global Security Kit (GSKit) libraries needed for SSL (HTTPS).

Without the GSKit libraries, the IBM web server Plug-in will be unable to initialize SSL, and will use only HTTP for connections to the WAS appservers. 

SYMPTOM
During web server start-up, errors like the following will be logged into the Plug-in log file (http_plugin.log): 

ERROR: lib_security: loadSecurityLibrary: Failed to load gsk library from /opt/IBM/WebSphere/Plugins/gsk8/gsk8_64
ERROR: ws_transport: transportInitializeSecurity: Unable to load security library
ERROR: ws_server: serverAddTransport: Failed to initialize security
ERROR: ws_server: serverAddTransport: HTTPS Transport is skipped


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the problem, you must set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to point to the library directory of the GSKit that comes with the IBM web server Plug-in. The precise directory location will depend of the version of Plug-in, and on the bit depth being used (32-bit or 64-bit). 

 

For example..... 

If you installed the 32-bit Plug-in v7.0 and are using with a 32-bit Apache 2.2, use this: 

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/IBM/WebSphere/Plugins/gsk7/lib/ 

 

If you installed the 64-bit Plug-in v7.0 and are using it with a 32-bit Apache 2.2, use this: 

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/IBM/WebSphere/Plugins/gsk7/gsk7_32/lib/ 

 

If you installed the 64-bit Plug-in v7.0 and are using it with a 64-bit Apache 2.2, use this: 

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/IBM/WebSphere/Plugins/gsk7/gsk7_64/lib64/ 

 

If you installed the 32-bit Plug-in v8.x and are using with a 32-bit Apache 2.2, use this: 

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/IBM/WebSphere/Plugins/gsk8/lib/ 

 

If you installed the 64-bit Plug-in v8.x and are using it with a 32-bit Apache 2.2, use this: 

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/IBM/WebSphere/Plugins/gsk8/gsk8_32/lib/ 

 

If you installed the 64-bit Plug-in v8.x and are using it with a 64-bit Apache 2.2, use this: 

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/IBM/WebSphere/Plugins/gsk8/gsk8_64/lib64/ 

 

 

Please note that for Apache 2.2 on Linux, simply setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable from the command line prior to starting the web server, MAY NOT WORK. In that case, you must set this variable as follows...

For SLES and SUSE Linux add the export command into the /usr/sbin/envvars file.

For RHEL Linux add the export command into the /etc/sysconfig/httpd file.

By adding the export command into the files shown above, it means that the environment variable will be set when the web server is started. That will enable the Plug-in to be able to locate the appropriate GSKit libraries and be able to initialize SSL transports.

 IBM Deleting Box folders and content from IBM Case Manager 5.3.0 - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 After configuring Box as a repository for Case Manager, Case Client users would like to delete documents and/or folders created under the Box collaboration folder. There does not appear to be any mechanism to perform this deletion. 

ANSWER
There is no support for deleting documents and/or folders from a Box Collaboration folder created via Case Manager at this time. Case workers who created the Box collaboration folder will have Viewer/Uploader permission on the Box Collaboration folder, and therefore, will not be able to delete content within a Box collaboration folder as this may result in missing data in the associated cases. Users who are invited to collaborate on the Box collaboration folder have the same restriction. 

Here is a link to Box collaboration permissions to clarify what permissions a Viewer/Uploader has

1) The symptom, cause and the remedial action mentioned in this technote applies to both .NET Framework agent and the ITCAM for IIS agent.
2) Even if you have IIS 7.0 - you should install the IIS 6.0 Management Compatibility Pack. This is not a part of IIS 6.0, but instead is a compatibility pack that is needed for higher IIS versions (IIS 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5). This option is found under the role services for IIS Web server.

Detailed instructions are as follows:

(i) Ensure the following IIS Role Services are installed:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IIS 6 Management Compatibility
IIS 6 Metabase Compatibility
IIS 6 WMI Compatibility
IIS 6 Scripting Tools
IIS 6 Management Console

 IBM NUM_IOSERVERS=AUTOMATIC behaviour is changed from 10.5FP7 - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 After updating to 10.5FP7 from an older fixpack level, I noticed that AUTOMATIC value for NUM_IOSERVERS is changed even though any settings are not changed. Is it expected bahavior? 

ANSWER
Yes, it is expected. Due to IT09990, we changed the fomula for calculating the number of prefetchers to start at database activation time.
Until 10.5FP6, we use following fomula:
number of prefetchers =
max( max( max over all table spaces( parallelism setting ),
number of cores * number of SMT threads ), 16 )

Starting from 10.5FP7, we use following fomula:
number of prefetchers =
max( max( max over all table spaces( parallelism setting ),
number of cores * number of SMT threads ), 12 )

So you can see the following output in 10.5FP6 and FP7:

FP6:
$ db2 get db cfg | grep NUM_IOSERVERS
Number of I/O servers (NUM_IOSERVERS) = AUTOMATIC(16)

FP7
$ db2 get db cfg | grep NUM_IOSERVERS
Number of I/O servers (NUM_IOSERVERS) = AUTOMATIC(12)

CAUSE
This behavior may occur if an invalid entry has been specified in the User Display Name Attribute or Group Display Name Attribute setting in the Directory Services Configuration in FileNet Enterprise Manager (FEM). 

Workplace XT attempts to resolve the user names and groups defined within the Access Roles based on the Directory Service configuration defined in FEM. If the user name query resolves to null or if there is an invalid entry a NullPointerException error may occur. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 In FEM, change the User Display Name Attribute or Group Display Name Attribute to a valid LDAP entry such as cn, displayName or uid and restart the FileNet Content Engine and Workplace XT instances. 

 IBM Replacement of an expiring certificate on the IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance - United States SSL HTTPS TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 What is the procedure for replacing an expiring certificate that is in use on the DataPower appliance with a newly obtained certificate? 

CAUSE
Once you have obtained a new certificate from your certificate authority and are ready to replace the expiring one currently in use by your DataPower configuration with this new certificate, there is no single prescribed manner in which to perform the replacement operation. The following information presents some options for formulating an approach that best fits your environment.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
First, know your certificate material. It's not uncommon for newer certificates to be chained, so it is not a one for one replacement; the existing certificate on the DataPower appliance may need to be replaced by more than one certificate. Therefore, it is important to ensure you have the full certificate chain, as appropriate (i.e, the personal, intermediate and root certificates). Certificate authorities may send two certificates in the chain and expect the third one to be downloaded from their website. 


Here's a screenshot of a sample chain. Notice that you can check the 'Certification Path' tab if there are any remaining certificates in the chain. Also note the chain of "Issued To" and "Issued By" identities.
ExampleCertificateChain.jpg [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=2]ExampleCertificateChain.jpg [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=1]


As for the certificate configuration on DataPower, the appliance will reference the actual key and certificate files stored in the cert: directory by file name. Navigation in the WebGUI to the SSL Proxy Profile -> Crypto Profile -> Crypto Key and Certificate objects will show the current files referenced by the configuration.

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=3]


For example, your DataPower configuration may currently reference the existing files cert:///current-key.pem and cert:///current-cert.pem.

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=4]

As long as the replacement file(s) are NOT named the same as these files (i.e. the new ones are named cert:///new-key.pemand cert:///new-cert.pem for example), it is safe to load the new file(s) into the cert: directory at any time ahead of the replacement operation. Your existing configuration will not use the new files, so long as the Crypto Key and Certificate Objects still refer to the files associated with the expiring certificate (i.e. cert:///current-key.pem and cert:///current-cert.pem). 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=5] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=5]

Having both expiring and replacement files in the cert: directory at once allows for the capability to modify the configuration to point to the new files or revert it back to the expiring files relatively easily or to configure a new SSL Proxy Profile object that references the new files. The new SSL Proxy Profile could be used to test independently of the currently running configuration using a new test service such as an XML Firewall. 

You can navigate directly to the key and certificate objects using these paths: 
Objects → Crypto Configuration → Crypto Certificate.
Objects → Crypto Configuration → Crypto Key 

Another view is from Control Panel -> Keys and Certificate Management.

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=6] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=6]

Either way, note how the configuration ultimately references the files in the cert: directory and plan ahead for how you prefer to reference the new files. 

They may be swapped out within the existing Crypto Configuration objects (i.e. update the objects to reference the new file(s) or to revert to the expiring ones as needed). 

Alternatively, a new separate set of Crypto Configuration objects that reference the new files may be created and replacement performed at the Crypto object level by updating the configuration to reference the new replacement Crypto Configuration objects.

Important Note: If the replacement certificate has the same file name of the expired certificate, you MUST disable/enable the certificate object in order to clear all cached references to the expired certificate.

For more information on certificates, refer to the product documentation specific to your firmware and appliance type. Navigate to the Administrator's Guide, under "Managing the Appliance" - "Working with keys and certificates" from the WebSphere DataPower Product Documentation Portal [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21377654]. 

 IBM Portal 8 installation unable to detect the WebSphere Application Server - United States portal reinstall fails; install into existing WAS fails TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
The IBM Installation Manager is unable to detect that a WebSphere Application Server exists when attempting to install Portal.

SYMPTOM
This issue seems to manifest when an existing Portal has been uninstalled and WebSphere Application Server is not uninstalled. When Portal install is attempted again, but this time to install into the existing WebSphere Application Server then Installation Manager will throw an excecption that notes that it is unable to detect WebSphere Application Server on the system 

We have also seen an issue where the install fails indicating the version of WAS detected is insufficient and we see an exception like this in IIM logs:


49 INFO 00:03.14 This Cumulative Fix requires that IBM
WebSphere Portal Server version 8.0.0.0 be previously installed. You
must first install the base release and then update it with the
Cumulative Fix. You cannot install them at the same time.
50 ERROR 00:03.15 The required version 8.0.0.5 or later of
WebSphere Application Server has not been detected on this system.
Select the WebSphere Application Server Package to install WebSphere
Application Server and WebSphere Portal.
51 INFO 00:03.21 Stopping Installation Manager.
52 INFO 00:03.28 No log properties file found in:
/home/wasadmin/var/ibm/InstallationManager/logs



CAUSE
The issue is caused by Portal files that are not correctly removed from the AppServer folder structure when Portal is uninstalled.


ENVIRONMENT
Portal 8.0.0.x and WAS 8.0.0.x




RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Navigate to the AppServer folder and remove the following files (they are regenerated with a reinstall of Portal):

lib/ext/commons-codec-1.3.jar
lib/ext/commons-httpclient-3.0.1.jar
lib/ext/openid4java-full-0.9.5.jar
lib/ext/wp.auth.base.sua_RedirectServletFilter.jar

Select the Recheck Status button. It should now say "All prerequisites are met." 

 IBM Wrong codepoints for non-ASCII characters inserted in UTF-8 database using CLP - United States CLP; insert; codepage; unicode; wrong codepoints; CharConversionException TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 During insert from the CLP there is no codepage conversion if operating system codepage and database codepage are both UTF-8. In this case data to be inserted should also be in UTF-8 encoding.

If data has a different encoding then the database codepage (this can be verified using any hex editor), then the operating system codepage should be changed to match the data's encoding in order to enforce the data conversion to the database codepage. 

SYMPTOM
Error executing Select SQL statement. Caught by java.io.CharConversionException. ERRORCODE=-4220 

 Caused by: 
java.nio.charset.MalformedInputException: Input length = 4759 
at com.ibm.db2.jcc.b.u.a(u.java:19) 
at com.ibm.db2.jcc.b.bc.a(bc.java:1762) 


CAUSE
During an insert of data using CLP characters, they do not go through codepage conversion.
If operating system and database codepage both are UTF-8, but the data to be inserted is not Unicode, then data in the database might have incorrect codepoints (not-Unicode) and the above error will be a result during data retrieval. 

To verify the encoding for data to be inserted you can use any editor that shows hex representation of characters. Please verify the codepoints for non-ASCII characters that you try to insert. If you see only 1 byte per non-ASCII characters then you need to force the database conversion during insert from CLP to UTF-8 database. 

To force codepage conversion during insert from the CLP make sure that the operating system codepage is non-Unicode and matching to the codepage of data when you insert data to Unicode database from non-Unicode data source. 

Problem Details
An example problem scenario is as follows:


 1.  Create a database of type UTF-8:
     
     CREATE DATABASE <db> USING CODESET utf-8 TERRITORY US 
     
     
 2.  Create a table that holds character data:
     
     CREATE TABLE test (col char(20)) 
     
     
 3.  Check operating system locale:
     
     locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8 
     LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8" 
     
     
 4.  Insert the non-ASCII characters 'Ã' , '³', '©' which have codepoint 0x'C3', 0x'B3',0x'A9' in codepage 819 into the table:
     
     INSERT INTO test VALUES ('Ã')
     INSERT INTO test VALUES ('³')
     INSERT INTO test VALUES ('©') 
     
     
 5.  By running the following statement, you can see that all INSERT statements caused only one byte to be inserted into the table:
     
     SELECT col, HEX(col) FROM test
     
     
     Ã C3
     ³ B3
     © A9
     
     However, the UTF-8 representation of those characters are: 0x'C383' for 'Ã', 0x'C2B3' for '³', and 0x'C2A9' for '©'.
     So these three rows in the table contain invalid characters in UTF-8. 
     
     
 6.  When selecting from a column using the JDBC application, the following error will occur. This is expected because the table contains invalid UTF-8 data:
     Error executing Select SQL statement. Caught by java.io.CharConversionException. ERRORCODE=-4220
     Caused by:
     java.nio.charset.MalformedInputException: Input length = 4759
     at com.ibm.db2.jcc.b.u.a(u.java:19)
     at com.ibm.db2.jcc.b.bc.a(bc.java:1762) 
     
     
     
 7.  Delete all rows with incorrect Unicode codepoints from the test table:
     DELETE * from test 
     
     
 8.  Change the locale to one that matching codepage of data to be inserted:
     export locale=en_us. One of the way to determine the codepage for your data can be found here: http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/17201/Detect-Encoding-for-In-and-Outgoing-Text [http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/17201/Detect-Encoding-for-In-and-Outgoing-Text]. If you prepare data yourself using some editor please check the documentation for your editor to find out how to set up the codepage for data being prepared by the editor. 
     
     
 9.  Insert data to the table:
     INSERT INTO test VALUES ('Ã')
     INSERT INTO test VALUES ('³')
     INSERT INTO test VALUES ('©') 
     
     
 10. Verify that inserted data were converted to UTF-8 during insert:
     SELECT col, HEX(col) FROM test
     
     
     Ã C383
     ³ C2B3
     © C2A9 
     
     
 11. Run your java application selecting Unicode data. No exception should be reported. 




ENVIRONMENT
UNIX, Linux, Unicode database



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Verify that non-ASCII data have a proper Unicode codepoints in Unicode database



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Reinsert data with codepage conversion enforced by setting the operation system codepage matching to the codepage of data to be inserted

 IBM How to delete a document hierarchy node in IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture - United States dco document hierarchy node delete remove hide blank page TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I delete a document hierarchy node, such as a blank page, so that it no longer processes rules or appears in a batchview listing? 

CAUSE
It is sometimes desired to remove pages or documents from a batch, as they are no longer needed or to simplify processing for a Verify operator.

ANSWER
The DeleteChildType from the Validations library can be used by running it from the parent of the object to be deleted and specifying the specific child. 

For example, to remove blank pages from a batch: 

 1. Create a special page type attached at the batch level called something like DeleteMe. 
 2. Use an action like BlankPagesIDBySize to identify the blank page:  * BlankPagesIDBySize (1000,DeleteMe)
    
    
 3. Create a rule with the action DeleteChildType(DeleteMe) and attach it at the batch level to have it remove all pages with page type DeleteMe.


If building a custom action, the DeleteChild API method is invoked from the parent object.

When you do a broad search with a small keyword, you expect to receive many entries in return. When your search is more specific, you use a longer keyword to try to narrow the search. However, when you expect fewer returns from your search, it does not happen. The user list remains empty. 

You can find the following exception in the SystemOut.log file:

[8/7/12 14:02:59:435 CEST] 000000xx exception E com.ibm.ws.wim.

CAUSE
In some cases, LDAP might take longer to respond on a more specific search, which results in an LDAP timeout. 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this issue, increase the LDAP timeout limit by using one of the following options: 

 

 * Option 1 
   Use the wsadmin command:
   $AdminTask updateIdMgrLDAPServer {-id AD -connectTimeout 0} 
   $AdminConfig save 
   
   
   After it is saved, view the wimconfig.xml file and make sure you see connectTimeout="0" 
   
   
   You can find the wimconfig.xml file in the following locations in the deployment manager configuration:  * {WAS_HOME}\profiles\profile_name\config\cells\cell_name\wim\config\wimconfig.xml
      
      
    * profile_root/conf/cells/cell_name/wim/config/wimconfig.xml
   
   
   
   A complete restart of the WebSphere Application Server / IBM Business Process Manager environment is required to make this change take effect.
   
   
 * Option 2 
   You will edit the wimconfig.xml file directly. However, before you edit the file, make a backup copy of it. Edit the wimconfig.xml file and search forconnectTimeout. Change this value from connectTimeout="20" to connectTimeout="0" and save the file. 
   
   
   A complete restart of the WebSphere Application Server / IBM Business Process Manager environment is required to make this change take effect.


Note: The connectTimeout increment value is in seconds of time. The example value 0 is to wait indefinitely. Different values can be set accordingly.

 IBM Diagnosing a java.lang.StackOverflowError - United States StackOverflow; overflowing; recursion; recursively; jit; JustInTime; Hot; Spot; WebSphere; Just-In-Time TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Stack Overflow exceptions can occur when a thread stack continues to grow in size until reaching the maximum limit. 

SYMPTOM
 A stack overflow can result from: 

 * A deeply nested application 
 * An infinite loop within an application 
 * A problem in just-in-time (JIT) compiled code 
 * Applications requiring a larger stack size, especially ones relying on XML, GUI, or java2D classes. 
 * Native method calls


Stack overflow issues are frequently masked by Out of Memory exceptions. By resolving the memory constraints, the stack overflow can be resolved. 
CAUSE
When a stack overflow occurs, the amount of stack space required by the program exceeds what is configured for the stack in the Java™ Virtual Machine (JVM) process, or the native stack size configured by the operating system. 
Some applications require stacks that are larger than the default size; for example, a graphics-intensive Java program can require a larger stack, which may require an increase in the stack size to avoid StackOverflow.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Look for either Out of Memory messages or java.lang.StackOverflow in the server logs. The process may continue to run after either of these messages are seen. 


If a crash did occur, a javacore should have generated on IBM SDK. You will either see the signal as SIGSEGV, SIGILL, SIGABRT, or SIGBUS. Usually the current thread will indicate the following




pending=java.lang.StackOverflowError

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21162896&aid=1]Explanations and Solutions
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21162896&amp;aid=2]Detailed Configuration Options 






 

Explanations and Solutions 

Infinite Recursion 
If an application is performing recursion, the maximum stack size can easily be reached and a Stack Overflow exception is thrown. The thread stack has a limited size and eventually its space will run out as the thread stack grows without bounds. 

Some traits of recursion: 
- Large thread stacks that appear to repeat 
- An infinite loop that continuously spawns off threads 
- Very large XML documents loaded into the Document Object Model (DOM) 
- JSP or servlets calling itself (usually by executing forward or include to itself) 
- Repeated calls in native functions 

Increasing the thread stack size allows for larger thread stacks. However if the recursion continues to trigger a stack overflow, the next step is to identify what code is causing the recursion from javacores, thread dumps, or even system core files. 

A thread stack that indicates it's too large to display can be an indicator of stack overflow. This is especially true if the stack appears to repeat (such as recursive method calls). 

JIT/HotSpot Compiled Code 

The JIT/HotSpot compiler (JIT) is designed to speed up the JVM execution times by compiling method calls. This can speed up execution time, but as more aggressive optimizations are used, this can inadvertently cause recursion, resulting in stack overflow or crash. The documents linked below explain how to debug JIT and HotSpot compiler issues:  * JIT Problem Determination for IBM SDK 5.0 and 6.0 using -Xjit [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg21294023] 
 * Debugging HotSpot failures on the Solaris and HP-UX operating environment [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg21081179]



Depleted Native Stack 
It is almost guaranteed that a crash will occur if the native stack runs out of space. System cores can be used to identify long and possibly recursively looping native thread stacks. 

To resolve, increase the native stack size (usually by adjusting the operating system limit for stack size) to accommodate the recursive native calls; however, identifying the recursive native calls will help determine the root cause of the stack overflow.

Detailed Configuration Options 

Adjusting the Stack Sizes (Xss and Xmso) options 
If this does not work, you can adjust the stack sizes. Doubling the stack size is suggested as a first step; however, every thread that the JVM creates will consume memory. Be careful to not exhaust your physical and heap memory resources. 

For every Java thread, there are two stacks that are utilized. One is for Java code for method calls, and the other is for native C code (on Solaris and HP-UX, only the native stack is utilized). These are adjustable and can be raised to provide more room on the stacks to prevent an overflow. 

 * Maximum Thread Stack Size (-Xss)
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *  -Xss<size> 
 * 
 * <size>
 * 
 * nn[k|m|g|K|M|G]

Javacore 

In javacores, look for "StackOverflowError" in the thread name entry: 3XMTHREADINFO "ORB.thread.pool : 19" (TID:10167F78, sys_thread_t:E072BCE0, state:R, native ID:E06BEBA0) prio=5: pending=java.lang.StackOverflowError 
System Dump (processed with jextract and DTFJ Dump Analyzer) 

Look for this message near the end of a very large stack. This particular example had 1000 recursively called entries. Java stack frames dump is too long: <analyzererror>

 IBM ITCAM Data Collector connection to the Managing Server fails with Connection Refused. - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The Data Collector (DC) connection may fail with “Connection Refused” if the Managing Server’s(MS) host name can resolve to an IP address that cannot reach the MS. 

CAUSE
The DC obtains the MS kernel’s network address from the MS. If a host name is specified for the kernel, and any of it’s resolved IP addresses cannot reach the MS from the DC, ITCAM’s connection attempt will fail if one of these "invalid” IP’s is used.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Instead of host name, specify a “valid” IP address for the MS in the <MS_HOME>/bin/setenv.sh file, and in ITCAM 6.1, the ms.properties file. This solution usually works except when there is a firewall with Network Address Translation (NAT) enabled. In that case, you must make network changes so that all the resolved IPs can reach the MS. 

Change as directed:

ITCAM 6.0 ( or earlier )
In MS_home/bin/setenv.sh:
KERNEL_HOST01=<ip addr of MS>
KERNEL_HOST02=<ip addr of MS>

ITCAM 6.1
In MS_home/bin/setenv.sh:
KERNEL_HOST01=<ip addr of MS>
am_socket_bindip=<ip addr of MS>
am_socket_exportip=<ip addr of MS>
In MS_HOME/etc/ms.properties, modify “kernel.hosts” specifying MS IP address:
kernel.hosts=<ip addr of MS>CBSPort:RFSPort:RMIPort - usually -
kernel.hosts=<ip addr of MS>9122:9120:9118

Example:
kernel.hosts=9.12.20.220:9122:9120:9118

Example of the error message:
This example is from z/OS, but the problem can occur on any platform.

To determine IP addresses for a given MS host name [issue on the DC]:
nslookup <MS_host_name> 

To test basic connectivity, for each IP address listed by NSLOOKUP, issue:

1. Introduction
===============

This feature allows users to define scripts to run at Tivoli Monitoring OS agents sites at a defined frequency.

The feature is enabled by default. The administrator can enable/disable it by setting a new environment variable 
KXX_FCP_SCRIPT=true/false (default true)in the agent configuration file, where XX can be:

- LZ for Linux OS agent 
- UX for Unix OS agent
- NT for Windows OS agent

This is an overview of the scripting feature; details will be provided in the following sections.

The OS agent loops, at a configurable interval, looking for script definition property files (*.properties) in a configurable directory path.
The property files are parsed and OS Monitoring Agent spawns a new process named “fcp_daemon” if at least one valid script definition is found. This new daemon is responsible for scheduling the script executions and gathering all information regarding running scripts.

According to another configurable interval, the OS agent loops getting the execution script results from the fcp_daemon.
The OS Agent is able to parse the script standard output, splitting each row in up to 16 attributes.
An event is sent for each standard output row of the script and these events can be caught by pure event situations.

1.1 Quick Start
================
The feature is enabled with default values as soon as the OS agent is started. The only action to start using the feature is the following:
- create a property file under default directory (on Linux/UNIX is $CANDLEHOME/localconfig/<product code>/scripts_definitions, on Windows is %CANDLE_HOME%\localconfig\nt\scripts_definitions) using as an example the provided template script_property.txt.

Only two properties are required:
ATTRIBUTE_NAME=Any name used to uniquely identify the script definition inside the property file.
SCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS=The fully qualified path of the script with arguments. 

Not only shell scripts but also perl and other types of scripts can be used. You just need to specify the full command to execute in the SCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS property. 
For example, "perl C:\IBM\scripts\ITM_Custom_Scripts\date.pl". In this example you need to make sure that the location of "perl" can be resolved by the agent through the PATH variable in its environment. Specify the full path where "perl" is installed otherwise.

Further properties and details can be found in this document and in the template script_property.txt under $CANDLEHOME/localconfig/lz/scripts_definitions. 


2. New Attribute groups
=======================

Two new attribute groups have been added for this feature as detailed below. Statistic and execution data of all the scripts are stored in these two tables. The name of the property file (Property_File) and the attribute name defined in the property file (Attribute_Name) are the 2 key fields of these two tables. These two keys must be used in situation conditions to filter rows related to a specific script.

Attribute group: KXX_Custom_Scripts (multiple rows), table: KXXSCRPTS (sampled).
Description: Configuration and statistic data gathered using custom scripts. It contains a row for each defined script, information on the fcp_daemon and on property files:

3. Parameters in OS agent environment files
===========================================

It is possible to customize the feature setting parameters in the OS agent environment files:
- $CANDLEHOME/config/lz.ini file for the Linux OS agent
- $CANDLEHOME/config/ux.ini for the UNIX OS agent
- %CANDLE_HOME%\TMAITM6_x64\KNTENV for Windows 64bit OS agent
- %CANDLE_HOME%\TMAITM6\KNTENV for Windows 32bit OS agent

The scripting feature is enabled by default. To disable it set:
- KXX_FCP_SCRIPT=false

Other parameters can be defined inside the agent environment files based on specific needs:

- KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_DEFINITIONS (default location on Linux/UNIX is $CANDLEHOME/localconfig/<product code>/scripts_definitions, on Windows it is %CANDLE_HOME%\localconfig\nt\scripts_definitions)
The location where property files are stored.

- KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_INTERVAL (default 60 sec)
OS agent uses the value of this variable as loop interval in seconds to check execution of running scripts and it sends events if the filter condition is satisfied. The minimum value is 30 seconds, the maximum value is 300 seconds. Invalid values will be reset to the default.
Note: this parameter is ignored if KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_SYNC_INTERVALS is set to USE_SCRIPT (see definition below).

- KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_SYNC_INTERVALS (USE_AGENT|USE_SCRIPT|NO - default USE_AGENT)
If the agent looping interval defined by KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_INTERVAL is bigger than the script execution frequency, it can happen that data produced by some of the script execution loops is lost.
To avoid this behaviour the script execution frequency can be synchronized with the agent looping interval setting the KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_SYNC_INTERVALS to:
- USE_AGENT; the value of each script execution frequency is forced to be the maximum between KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_INTERVAL and EXECUTION_FREQUENCY defined in its property file. 
- USE_SCRIPT; the agent looping interval is dynamically set to the minimum frequency value (EXECUTION_FREQUENCY in property file) between all of the defined scripts . The value set by KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_INTERVAL is ignored. The frequency of the scripts remain the ones defined in the property files. When using USE_SCRIPT, the agent looping interval may change every time a script definition is added, changed or removed. In any case, it cannot be lower than the value set by KXX_FCP_OVERRIDE_MIN_FREQUENCY_LIMIT or bigger than 300 seconds.
- NO; no synchronization is performed and some execution results could be lost.

- KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_DEFINITIONS_CHECK_INTERVAL (default 300 sec) 
At startup and at every interval defined by this variable, the OS agent checks for any changes in scripts or property files.
Note that if KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_DEFINITIONS_CHECK_INTERVAL is less than the agent looping interval it will be reset to the agent looping interval. The maximum allowed value is the default, 300 seconds.

- KXX_FCP_USER (default OS agent user)
This parameter is valid only on linux and unix platforms. It defines the user used to spawn fcp_deamon process if different from OS agent process user; all the scripts are executed by this user. Note that the user owner of the OS agent must have correct permission to spawn the fcp_daemon process. On windows a different user must be defined as login of the service "Monitoring Agent for Windows OS - FCProvider". The user must have "Full Control" permission to CANDLE_HOME and scripts repository directories. For more information please refer to official IBM Monitoring documentation: 
http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSTFXA_6.3.0.2/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3fp2/oswin/running_as_a_non-admin_user.htm [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSTFXA_6.3.0.2/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3fp2/oswin/running_as_a_non-admin_user.htm]

- KXX_FCP_MAX_CDP_DP_THREAD_POOL_SIZE (default 10)
It defines the maximum concurrent number of scripts to be executed. Maximum value is 32.

- KXX_FCP_MAX_DAEMON_RESTARTS (default 4)
The OS agent watches the fcp_daemon: if an abnormal exit of process occurs, the OS agent restarts it. This is done for the KXX_FCP_MAX_DAEMON_RESTARTS (times at a day). 
The value 0 must be used to avoid the restart; if -1 is set, the OS agent retries to restart fcp_daemon forever. The restart counter is reset at OS agent restart.

- KXX_FCP_SEND_SCRIPT_RUNTIME_EVENTS (default: true)
If set to false, the OS agent stops sending events for each row of script standard output. In this case script outputs are visible on TEP console workspaces but no situations will be displayed and no historical collection data will be collected. 

- KXX_FCP_OVERRIDE_MIN_FREQUENCY_LIMIT (default: 5 seconds) 
It is used when KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_SYNC_INTERVALS is set to USE_SCRIPT. In this condition, it sets the minimum value of the OS agent looping interval.
Using low values for the the OS agent looping interval (less than 5 seconds) is highly invasive and can impact OS agent performances. If a frequent data collection is needed (e.g. every second), it is strongly suggested to customize a script that caches data at the needed frequency and returns the collected data to the OS agent at an higher interval (e.g. every 60 seconds).


The following Agent Builder (CDP) variables can also be used to control the behavior of the fcp_daemon:

- CDP_DP_REFRESH_INTERVAL (default 60 sec) Global script scheduled start time. Used if the frequency is not passed in the script property file.

- CDP_DP_SCRIPT_TIMEOUT (default 30 sec) Global script execution maximum time. When the execution time of a script exceeds this limit, its Status_Code is set to TIMEOUT

- CDP_DP_KILL_ORPHAN_SCRIPTS (Y|N - default N) Global behaviour used by fcp_daemon process for timing out scripts. When set to 'Y', the scripts are killed, otherwise they are abandoned. This value is ignored for a specific script if the KILL_AFTER_TIMEOUT key is set in the script property file

- CDP_MAXIMUM_ROW_COUNT_FOR_CPCI_DATA_RESPONSES (default 1000) Global value added for performance reasons to limit the maximum number of output rows returned by the scripts. Additional rows after this limit are ignored. Allowed values are positive integer. Invalid values means no limit.

The fcp_daemon also supports the other environment variables used to control Agent Builder agents. For a complete list see the official Agent Builder documentation here:
http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v61r1/topic/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3/agentbuilder63_user.pdf [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v61r1/topic/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3/agentbuilder63_user.pdf]

4. Parameters in property files 
===============================

The KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_DEFINITIONS directory contains a list of *.properties files. Each property file contains a list of 
scripts to run with respective properties in the form of key=value. The properties that can be defined (case in-sensitive) are: 

- ATTRIBUTE_NAME (Required - string max 256 characters).
It is a name of your choice that defines a specific script and its attributes. The characters that can be used for the 
ATTRIBUTE NAME name can be alphabetical, numeric and only the underscore can be used as a special character. If other special characters (even a blank is considered this way) are used they get converted into underscore (_).
When multiple scripts are listed inside the same property file, more different ATTRIBUTE_NAME must be defined (one for each script). It must be the first value specified for each defined script and delimits the start of the properties set for the specific script until the next ATTRIBUTE_NAME.

- SCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS (Required - string max 512 characters).
It defines the full path to the script with parameters, separated by a blank. No special characters can be used in the script path name. 
Values containing blanks must be enclosed in single (') or double quotes (").
Environment variables can be passed, but only enclosed in ${...} for all the platforms. Environment variables must be available in the OS agent process context.

- EXECUTION_FREQUENCY (Optional - default 60 sec).
It indicates the script execution frequency.

- CUSTOM_NAME (Optional - string max 256 characters)
The user can fill it with a description of the script.

- IS_ACTIVE (true|false - Optional - default true). 
It activates the script. If false, the script is not executed.

- DISABLE_USE_AGENT_SYNC (true|false - Optional - default false). If true, the EXECUTION_FREQUENCY of the script is respected also if the global variable KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_SYNC_INTERVALS is set to USE_AGENT.

- KILL_AFTER_TIMEOUT (true|false - Optional - default value defined by the CDP_DP_KILL_ORPHAN_SCRIPTS variable). 
When true the script is killed after timeout (a timeout occurs when script execution is greater than the value specified by CDP_DP_SCRIPT_TIMEOUT parameter in OS agent configuration file) otherwise it is ignored. In both cases no data is collected. Note that when KILL_AFTER_TIMEOUT is set, only the script defined in property file is killed and not child processes (if any) spawned by the script. This feature is not supported by Solaris and Windows 32 bit OS agents and any timing out scripts are abandoned. 


Output rows returned by a script are parsed. The script returns a standard output (called hereafter as first token). When the script returns more values in the output row they are added as additional tokens for a maximum of 5 strings, 5 integers and 5 floats following a predefined syntax as described below:

- OUTPUT_TYPE (STRING|INTEGER|FLOAT - Optional - default string). It defines the type of the first token returned by each row of the script;
OUTPUT_TYPE can be:
1. STRING (default): strings up to 2048 characters. When used, the "Standard_Output_String" attribute of KXX_Custom_Scripts_Runtime is filled in by the first token.
2. INTEGER: allows getting numeric values between -9223372036854775806 and 9223372036854775806. When used, the "Standard_Output_Integer" attribute of KXX_Custom_Scripts_Runtime is filled in by the first token.
3. FLOAT: allows getting numeric values between -92233720368547758.06 and 92233720368547758.06,(with 2 decimal
precision). When used, the "Standard_Output_Float" attribute of KXX_Custom_Scripts_Runtime is filled in by the first token.

- TOKEN_TYPES (STRING|INTEGER|FLOAT - Optional).
It defines the output type of additional tokens after the first one. The user can define a maximum of 5 strings, 5 integers and 5 floats. It is a list of types separated by commas:
<token_type>,<token_type>,…
token_type can be empty or one from (case insensitive):
- STRING or S
- INTEGER or I
- FLOAT or F
If <token_type> is empty, the corresponding token is skipped.
Examples of the same valid layouts:
- TOKEN_TYPES=S,I,S,,,F,,F,F
- TOKEN_TYPES=String,integer,S,,,Float,,f,FLOAT

- TOKEN_LABELS (STRING - maximum 16 characters each label - Optional). 
It defines the labels of the tokens defined in TOKEN_TYPES. This value is a list of token labels separated
by commas, and must correspond to the tokens defined by TOKEN_TYPES. 
e.g.:
- TOKEN_TYPES=S,I,S,,,F,,F,F
- TOKEN_LABELS=Cpu Name,Cpu number,Description,,,value 1,,value 2,value 3 
It is ignored if TOKEN_TYPES is not set.

- TOKEN_SEPARATOR (Optional - default semicolon ";"). 
It sets the string to be used as separator to split the output row in tokens. It is ignored if TOKEN_TYPES is not set. Empty value (blank) is accepted as separator and multiple consecutive blanks in output rows are considered as a single one.


The following two parameters allow you to filter the rows output of a script; they are applied by the OS agent only to the first token and they must be used together:

- FILTER_VALUE (Optional).
The value used for comparison. It is required if FILTER_OPERATOR is defined.
If the OUTPUT_TYPE is a string, the filter value must reflect exactly the string value returned by the script that is intended to be filtered, without any additional quotes (no wildcards allowed).
- FILTER_OPERATOR (Optional).
The operator used for the comparison. It is required if FILTER_VALUE is defined. Accepted FILTER_OPERATOR values include:
= (equal to)
!= (different from)
> (bigger than) only for numeric type
>= (not lower than) only for numeric type
< (lower than) only for numeric type
<= (not bigger than) only for numeric type



5. Examples of property file
============================

The private situations definitions can be inserted into the xx_situations.xml under $CANDLEHOME/localconfig/lz for linux or $CANDLEHOME/localconfig/ux for unix or %CANDLE_HOME%\localconfig\nt for Windows to monitor scripts execution.
Examples below are for the Linux OS agent:

<PRIVATESIT>
<!-- Sends an alert if the script defined by attribute name "demo" in property file "demo.properties" returns a row equal to "demo.log" -->
<SITUATION>FCP_CheckLOGFileExists_pr</SITUATION>
<criteria>
<![CDATA[*VALUE KLZ_Custom_Scripts_Runtime.Property_File *EQ 'demo.properties' *AND *VALUE KLZ_Custom_Scripts_Runtime.Attribute_Name *EQ 'demo' *AND *VALUE KLZ_Custom_Scripts_Runtime.Standard_Output_String *EQ 'demo.log']]>
</CRITERIA>
</PRIVATESIT>

<PRIVATESIT>
<!-- Sends an alert if a script exits with a return code different from zero -->
<SITUATION>FCP_ScriptRetCode_pr</SITUATION>
<CRITERIA>
<![CDATA[*IF *VALUE KLZ_Custom_Scripts.Return_Code *NE 0]]>
</CRITERIA>
</PRIVATESIT>

<privatesit>
<!-- Sends an alert when script path is not defined in a property file -->
<SITUATION NAME="FCP_NOPTAH" INTERVAL="000030" ></SITUATION>
<criteria>
<![CDATA[*VALUE KLZ_Custom_Scripts.Status_Code *EQ NO_SCRIPT_PATH]]>
</criteria>
</privatesit>

<privatesit>
<!-- Sends an alert when a script cannot be launched -->
<SITUATION NAME="FCP_ScriptLaunchErr" INTERVAL="000060" ></SITUATION>
<criteria>
<![CDATA[*VALUE KLZ_Custom_Scripts.Status_Code *EQ SCRIPT_LAUNCH_ERROR]]>
</criteria>
</privatesit>


7. Custom Scripts and Custom Scripts Runtime Workspaces
=======================================================

A new OS agent navigation item has been added in the TEP console. It contains two workspaces: "Custom Scripts" and "Custom Scripts Runtime". 

"Custom Scripts" workspace contains the following views:
- "Factory Daemon Status" table view showing informational/warning/error events related to the fcp_daemon process.
- "Properties Files error" table view showing problems related to property files.
- "Number of execution per script" bar chart view summarizing the executions of defined scripts
- "Defined Scripts" table view showing detailed information of defined scripts.

"Custom Scripts Runtime" workspace is called clicking on the anchor of a specific script and provides information on script execution. The views provided by default on the TEP console are to be intended as example workspaces with all available custom attributes. Users can duplicate and customize workspaces to filter out fields that are not needed according to the output returned by their scripts.


8. Known problems and limitations
===================================

- The Scripting Feature is not supported on Windows 2003 64-bit systems.
- Kill after timeout does not work on Solaris and Windows 32 bit OS agents.
- The fcp_daemon may stop executing scripts in Windows 32 bit If some scripts do not complete within the time out period and the user has turned on intensive tracing. If this happens the data reported on the TEP will reflect the last time the script was actually run. It is also possible that the OS agent will stop returning data. Terminating the fcp_daemon process will allow the agent to resume proper operation.
- SCRIPT_NONZERO_RETURN is returned instead of SCRIPT_NOT_FOUND or SCRIPT_LAUNCH_ERROR on Solaris.
- The scripting feature does not provide full Native Language Support; some issues may be found using Nationalized characters in property files or script outputs.
- On windows OS agent there is no possibility of executing scripts residing on a mapped network drive.

9. Troubleshooting
===================

Standard KBB_RAS1 variable will apply to the OS agent and to the fcp_daemon processes.
To apply a specific trace setting to fcp_daemon only, use the KXX_FCP_KBB_RAS1 variable; when KXX_FCP_KBB_RAS1 is set, the value specified by KBB_RAS1 is ignored by fcp_daemon.

To trace the operations logged by the OS agent core threads of the feature:
KBB_RAS1=ERROR (UNIT:factory ALL)

To trace scripting queries from the ITM server and events sent to the server, add the entries:
(UNIT:klz34 ALL) (UNIT:klz35 ALL) on Linux OS agent
(UNIT:kux48 ALL) (UNIT:kux49 ALL) on Unix OS agent
(UNIT:knt84 ALL) (UNIT:knt85 ALL) on Windows OS agent

To view tema traces to verify private situation execution, add the entries:
(UNIT:kraavp all) (UNIT:kraapv all)

To see the execution of the scripts and how the data from the scripts is being parsed set:
KXX_FCP_KBB_RAS1=Error (UNIT:command ALL)

To troubleshoot problems in the communication between the os agent and fcp_daemon add this trace level to both KBB_RAS1 and KXX_FCP_KBB_RAS1:
(UNIT:cps_socket FLOW) (UNIT:cpci FLOW)

To see the interaction between the OS agent process and the fcp_daemon in detail add to both KBB_RAS1 and KXX_FCP_KBB_RAS1:
(UNIT:cps_socket ALL) (UNIT:cpci ALL)


10. Quick Start Scenario
=========================

The following section describes the minimum steps needed to configure a linux OS agent to run 2 custom scripts.

Custom Scripts descriptions
===========================
Let's suppose the user has 2 scripts under a directory /scripts_repo:

- checkDIRsize.sh that checks the size of a specified directory passed as input parameter. Its output is an integer like the following: 

4594740

- cpu_mem_usage.sh that checks the used CPU percentages and used Swap Memory megabytes. Its output is returned in the following form:

cpu1|96,5|23800

where the first token is the CPU id, the second token is the used CPU percentage, the third token is the used swap memory in megabyte.

Customization needed to have the linux OS agent run above scripts
==============================================================
The feature is enabled with default values as soon as the OS agent is started:

- you could create one or two property files (<Any Name>.properties)under the default directory $CANDLEHOME/localconfig/lz/scripts_definitions. In this example let's create 2 property files one for each script called checkDIRsize.properties and cpu_mem_usage.properties:

#CheckDIRsize.properties
ATTRIBUTE_NAME=OPT_DIR_SIZE
SCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS=/scripts_repo/checkDIRsize.sh /opt
EXECUTION_FREQUENCY=20
OUTPUT_TYPE=INTEGER

#cpu_mem_usage.properties 
ATTRIBUTE_NAME=cpu_mem_usage
SCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS=/scripts_repo/cpu_mem_percentage.sh
OUTPUT_TYPE=string
TOKEN_TYPES=F,I
TOKEN_LABELS= Used CPU %, Swap MEM used MB
TOKEN_SEPARATOR=|
EXECUTION_FREQUENCY=10

- There is no need to restart the OS agent after adding (or changing) the 2 property files above: the OS agent checks script definition directory with a specified time interval (default value 300 seconds). Open the TEP console and under the "Custom Scripts" workspace the scripts details and results are shown.

Change History:
----------------------
2017-01-09: Added new item under "8. Known problems and limitations" that the Scripting Feature is not supported on Windows 2003 64-bit systems.

 IBM ERROR: Default DB path is not set, when adding database set on RHEL 5 - United States 1320206; ClearQuest; Command Line Tools; CQ; cqreg; add_dbset; initialize; CQ_DATABASES; CQDB_rgys; registry; db set; db_set; Default DB path is not set; Use cqreg initialize first; linux; RHEL; RHEL5 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote explains why the error, "Default DB path is not set", occurs when adding a connection with IBM® Rational® ClearQuest® on RedHat Enterprise Linux® (RHEL) 5. 

SYMPTOM
When running the command cqreg add_dbset, this error occurs:

"Default DB path is not set"
"Default version is 7.0.0"
/opt/rational/clearquest/CQDB_rgys/cqdb_registry/7.0.0 does not exist. Use cqreg initialize first. 

CAUSE
Normally, at the end of a ClearQuest installation on UNIX® based platforms, the cqreg initialize command runs automatically. The command creates the registry structure for database sets. During the installation, the command did not run successfully.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Verify that the CQDB_rgys directory exists, as defined in the installation options. The following is the default registry location: 


/opt/rational/clearquest/CQDB_rgys/cqdb_registry/

If not present, then the cqreg initialize command was not successful.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Run cqreg initialize. The add_dbset command will run successfully afterwards. However, should the same error persist, make sure the command is run as the root user. 



Also make sure that the CQ_DATABASES environment variable is set to the desired registry path. If it is not, set the variable accordingly, then run the previously mentioned commands again.

 IBM JAZZ 1.1.0.3 for WebGUI (Pre-Req) not installing. - United States TIPL2INST; DASHL2INST; CRIMA1217E; prereq_checker.bat; prereq_checker.bat TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Installation of Dashboard Application Service Hub (DASH) and Jazz for Service Management (JazzSM) components is failing even though the installation prerequisite scan apparently passed. 

CAUSE
Upon further investigation, it was discovered the customer had only used the product code for DASH during prerequisite scan. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
During installation the following error is seen in the GUI installation window and logs: 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


The above error typically means there is not enough room on the system for software to deploy and the installation to complete successfully. 
RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In order to accurately determine if the installation prerequisites have been met, the user must pass both product codes to the prerequisite scanner. In this case, the user must pass the codes for DASH and Jazz simultaneously to the prerequisite scanner script. 

The following table contains the product codes for the various integration services:
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21696179&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21696179&aid=1] 

In this particular case, in order to properly run the prerequisite scanner, the codes for DASH and JazzSM should be passed like this: 

 * 
 * 
 * 


The above will provide a detailed listing of the prerequisites for both products along with which items have passed and which items have failed and need to be addressed before the installation will succeed.

 IBM QRadar: Enabling On Event and Flow Hashing integrity checks with HMAC - United States Hashing; QRadar; HMAC; integrity; hashed message authentication code; authentication TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What is the performance impact of using HMAC, and how does QRadar handle key management?



ANSWER
The overhead of writing these files is negligible, regardless of the hashing method selected. HMAC is no more expensive than the default options supported by QRadar previously. Once enabled the 
HMAC keys are added to new Events and Flows as they are written. When attempting to run the integrity check, it will take some time depending on the amount of data being validated. It will not cause performance issues, assuming the system is not at maximum load for disk input. 

From more information on HMAC please refer to the section Checking the Integrity of Event and Flow Logs in the QRadar Administration Guide.

 IBM WebSphere DataPower spikes with high CPU when WebSphere MQ connection is unavailable - United States retries; high CPU; MQ queue manager; Retry Interval; Retry Attempts; Long Retry Interval TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why does WebSphere DataPower spike with a high CPU rate when a WebSphere MQ connection is unavailable? Is there a solution to this issue? 

CAUSE
If the value of Retry Attempts is set to 0 on the DataPower MQ Queue Manager object, this negates the benefits of the Long Retry Interval since it will not be used. DataPower will retry forever using the specified Retry Interval. The default setting of Retry Attempts as 0 and Retry Interval as 1 second is provided to preserve backward compatibility. However, these default values should be changed to take advantage of Long Retry Interval feature available in firmware.

ANSWER
The solution to the issue of having DataPower vulnerable to the MQ Queue Manager being inaccessible is to change the Retry Attempts parameter on the Configure MQ Queue Manager window from 0 to some number. As an example, change the parameters as follows: 

 *  Retry Attempts - change the default of 0 to 6 Retry Interval - change the default of 1 to 10 seconds Long Retry Interval - change the default of 1800 to 600 seconds (10 minutes) 


In the event that the Queue Manager is down or a connection is not established, the above example configuration will allow the MQ QM Object to retry 6 times with 10 second intervals. After 6 attempts, the MQ QM object will retry every 10 minutes.

Welcome to IBM(R) WebSphere(R) MQ for HP NonStop Server, Version 5.3.1.12

This release notes file applies to the latest WebSphere MQ cross-platform
books (for Version 5.3), and to the WebSphere MQ for HP NonStop Server,
Version 5.3 specific books (WebSphere MQ for HP NonStop Server System
Administration Guide and WebSphere MQ for HP NonStop Server Quick
Beginnings).

The content of these release notes applies to the WebSphere MQ for HP
NonStop Server product unless otherwise stated.

This release notes file contains information that was not available in
time for our publications. In addition to this file, README,
you can find more information on the WebSphere MQ Web site:

ABOUT THIS RELEASE
==================

Nomenclature
------------
The terms "WMQ V5.3.1" and "WMQ V5.3.1.0" both refer to the same WMQ Refresh
Pack without subsequent service installed. Throughout this readme, references
to "WMQ V5.3.1.x" refer to WMQ 5.3.1 with or without subsequent service
installed.

New in this release
-------------------

This is the twelfth FixPack for IBM WebSphere MQ V5.3.1 for HP NonStop Server,
and is designated V5.3.1.12, with associated APAR IT15471.

This release is cumulative for all service and internal defect correction 
performed since WMQ 5.3.1 was released. 

All native object and executable files distributed with this FixPack have the
following version procedure strings:

T0085H06_31MAY2016_V53_1_12_<buildid> (Where buildid is the internal build
identifier)

The Non-native library distributed with this FixPack has the following 
version procedure string:

T0085H06_28FEB2015_V53_1_11 

If upgrading from V5.3.1.5 or later releases, this FixPack does NOT require 
TNS (non-native) applications to be re-bound with the MQI library. More on 
this is described later on in this readme.

IBM have not identified any new HP NonStop Server system software problems
since V5.3.1.6 was released. The current set of recommended solutions is 
described later on in this readme.

IBM recommends that you ensure that your HP NonStop Server system software
products are at SPR levels that incorporate these fixes (solutions) as a
preventive measure. IBM has tested WMQ with these fixes in our own
environment before making the recommendations.

Important note about SSL channels
---------------------------------

This release includes a new version of openSSL (1.0.2h) to maintain currency
with known vulnerabilities discovered since the version shipped with V5.3.1.
A new version of the SSLupdate.pdf document was provided with the V5.3.1.10
fixpack, and is also included with this this release, located in the 
<install_path>/opt/mqm/READMES/en_US directory. If you use SSL channels you
should review the revised version of SSLupdate.pdf prior to installing this
fixpack.

The following SSL information applies if you are upgrading from WMQ V5.3.1 and
are using SSL channels. The following procedure is not required if you have 
already installed WMQ V5.3.1.1

Several of the fixes in this and previous FixPacks that relate to SSL channels
change the way that SSL certificates are configured with WebSphere MQ. If
you use SSL channels you will need to review the new documentation supplement
SSLupdate.pdf for information about this change and make configuration changes
Please also see the Post-installation section below for a summary of the
required changes.

In V5.3.1.10 Patch1 and all later releases, CipherSpecs that use the SSLv3
protocol were deprecated. Continued use of SSLv3 CipherSpec's is not recommended
but may be enabled by setting the AMQ_SSL_V3_ENABLE environment variable.
In addition to that Env01=AMQ_SSL_V3_ENABLE=1 has to be added to the MCA stanza 
of the queue manager's qmproc.ini file.

With OpenSSL 1.0.2h the following CipherSpecs have been deprecated:
DES_SHA_EXPORT1024
RC4_56_SHA_EXPORT1024
RC4_MD5_EXPORT
RC2_MD5_EXPORT
DES_SHA_EXPORT
TLS_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA

While WMQ V5.3.1.12 does still support these weak CipherSpecs for compatibility
reasons, they are deemed as not secure and should not be used. 

Please check product documentation to confirm the CipherSpec is valid and consult
documentation for any instructions when adding new environment variables.


Important note about WebSphere MQ V5.3 classes for Java and JMS
---------------------------------------------------------------

Fixpack V5.3.1.10 resolved an incompatibility between NonStop Java 7 and the
WMQ product libraries - that fix is also included in V5.3.1.12.
The method used to configure Java in V5.3.1.10 and later differs from 
that in releases prior to V5.3.1.10. The Java.pdf document shipped in the 
<install_path>/opt/mqm/READMES/en_US directory was updated to reflect the
change. Java/JMS users migrating from versions prior to 5.3.1.10 should 
review the updated document.

Important note about instmqm for V5.3.1
---------------------------------------

Since FixPack V5.3.1.5, IBM provided a modified WebSphere MQ product
installation script, instmqm, for any level of V5.3.1. The new installation
script includes a workaround for the OS problem introduced in G06.29/H06.06
where the OSS 'cp' command creates Guardian files in Format-2 form during an
installation rather than Format-1. This change caused problems binding and
compiling non-native and native COBOL applications, as well as wasting a lot of
disk space because of the very large default extents settings for the Format-2
files created by OSS cp.

Instmqm has been modified in FixPack V5.3.1.5 to work around this change in OSS
cp by forcing all Guardian files in an installation to be created as Format-1.
The use of the new installation script is recommended for all new V5.3.1
installations.

Existing installations that are not affected by the application relink or
rebind problems can remain as they are.

Product fix history
-------------------

The following problems are resolved in FixPack V5.3.1.12:

APAR IT08589 - WebSphere MQ V6 or V7 queues become "missing" from clusters. Application
calls to MQOPEN (sometimes MQPUT1, MQPUT) suffer queue name lookup
errors (Examples: 2085, 2082) when they try to access the affected 
cluster queues. 

APAR IT10388 - When the receiving QMgr has its channel set with SSLCAUTH(OPTIONAL),
the Nonstop Queue Manager insists on sending a certificate to 
identify itself. The remote side, however, does not require one

APAR IT11557 - Updated OpenSSL library to version 1.0.2h. This update deprecates sslchiph 
cipherspec TLS_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA and fixes various security 
vulnerabilities.

APAR IT12856 - When a node is removed from an MQ cluster and there is an automatically
defined cluster sender channel from a MQ node on NonStop to the removed
node, the sender channel on NonStop can go into state INITIALIZING and
stay there for up to 60 minutes instead of being deleted after the first
retry interval has expired.

APAR IT12875 - When a message is put into a remote/cluster queue within a TMF user
transaction and while the corresponding transmit queue is empty or almost
empty, it can take up to 60 seconds after the end of the transaction
until the message is transmitted. As a side effect automatic channel 
starts can also be delayed.

APAR IT12894 - Java 7 SSL clients behave differently than previous versions which 
resulted in an RC 2009 error on its connection attempt. This
is fixed with V.5.3.1.12.

APAR IT14169 - When a CPU is stopped, some sender channels were not recovered 
and stayed in inactive state. 

APAR IT15316 - Memory allocation during MCA and LQMA creation and initialization was
not handled properly and may result in an unresponsive system.

APAR IT15317 - Under some conditions agents stay alive but don't accept new
connections. That is the case if an agent has reached the maximum 
number of connections it is allowed to handle during its lifetime
but the agent can't terminate before the last connection has been 
closed.

APAR IT15490 - A configured process name rule has not been applied because it 
was defined with lower case characters, while the operating 
system interface delivered upper case process names. Since the name
comparison then fails the configuration is not applied.

The following fixes discovered during IBM's development and testing work were
also released with V5.3.1.12:

IN000100 - The CRTMQM command may fail with error 1017 if queue managers are 
created in parallel.

IN000101 - The installer has been enhanced to properly support SMF virtual disks
if the system revision is on H06.26 and newer or J06.15 and newer.

IN000102 - Removed access to uninitialized memory within mqconn which may result in
RC 2059 MQRC_Q_MGR_NOT_AVAILABLE.


Fixes introduced in previous fixpacks
=====================================
The following problems were resolved in FixPack V5.3.1.11:

APAR IT03572 - In V5.3.1.10, the dspmqver -V command displays the string 
"VPROC" rather than the VPROC string encoded in the product.
V5.3.1.11 corrects this problem.

APAR IT04083 - Error 30 received by Queue Server in a complex Queue Manager 
configuration using MQGMO_SET_SIGNAL. This is a result of
the limit on the number of outstanding messages sent by the 
process not being set to the same value as the internal counter.
This results in the Queue Server reporting "Guardian error 30 
attempting to send signal notification" in the queue manager 
error log.

APAR IT04533 - Cluster sender channels fail to start following a CPU failure
on a 2 CPU system when the Repository Manager and Channel Server
are both in the same CPU. Following the CPU failure, the Queue
Manager error log repeatedly reports message AMQ9422 
"Repository manager error, RC=545284114" 

APAR IT04876 - Some ssl channels with mismatched sslchiph cipherspecs run 
successfully because protocol versions are not compared. 

APAR IT05353 - Mitigation for SSLV3 POODLE Attack - CVE-2014-3566 

APAR IT07330 - WebSphere MQ V5.3.X Process does not write FDC (First 
Failure Symptom Report) records when the current FDC file is
physically full. This can result in processes experiencing error
conditions, but the error condition not being reported in the 
FDC file. This fix changes the error handling to identify this
scenario and switch to a new FDC file with an incremented 
sequence number 

APAR IV19854 - The master repository manager in a partial repository 
unnecessarily subscribes to each cluster queue manager that
it is aware of. This causes a significant increase in the number
of subscriptions that are made, and in large clusters this can
cause performance problems. 

APAR IY87702 - SIGSEGV resulting from failed getpwnam. In some circumstances
getpwnam can return a success value in errno, but a null
pointer as the user record. This results in a SIGSEGV from 
amqoamd. This change adds a check for this condition and handles
it correctly. 

APAR IY91357 - Altering a channel definition unintentionally resets the 
SSLPEER() attribute for the channel. 
When a channel with SSLPEER information is modified to include
either MSGEXIT or MSGDATA attributes, the SSLPEER attribute 
becomes blank. V5.3.1.11 resolves this problem. 

The following fixes discovered during IBM's development and testing work were
also released with V5.3.1.11:

909 - In the GA release, the TFILE was opened with depth 100 in the
Guardian NonStop process pairs. In configurations with large
large numbers of connecting applications/threads, this could
result in probe QS270000 errors from nspPrimary, with an Arith1
value of 83 (0083 Attempt to begin more concurrent transactions 
than can be handled). This change increases the TFILE open depth
to 1000. The default value can be changed from 1000 to a value
between 100 and 1000 using MQTFILEDEPTH environment variable.
If a value < 100 or > 1000 is specified, a value of 100 will
be used, and an FDC will be reported with the text
"Invalid MQTFILEDEPTH specified - using default"

1380 - In the cra library, several FFST code sites report an error 
without reporting the name of the channel involved in the error
condition. This change adds the channel name to the FFST report
in cases where the channel name is available to the calling code

1471 - In earlier releases of 5.3.1, if a garbage argument string is 
supplied to dspmqfls, the command abends rather than reporting a
usage message. V5.3.1.11 resolves this problem

1597 - In earlier releases of 5.3.1, the dspmqfls output shows a 
Queue/Status server value. Status servers were part of the V5.1
architecture but are not present in 5.3.1. V5.3.1.11 changes the 
message to reflect the fact that all objects are now managed by
Queue Servers.

2230 - In earlier releases of 5.3.1, the runmqsc command 
"DISPLAY QSTATUS(*) TYPE(HANDLE) ALL" does not cleanly handle a
scenario where there are more than 500 handles. Attempts to use
the command when there are more than 500 handles to be returned
results in FFSTs with probe NS013000 from nspReply, and probe
QS264002 from qslHandleHandleStatus. See later section on
"KNOWN LIMITATIONS, PROBLEMS AND WORKAROUNDS"

4158 - Slow memory leak in MQDISC in non-native library. In prior
releases, the non-native implementation of MQDISC contained a
slow memory leak. This resulted in applications performing 
repeated MQCONN/MQDISC operations during the process lifetime
eventually receiving a MQRC_STORAGE_NOT_AVAILABLE error from
MQCONN, and an FFST for probe ZS219001 from zstInsertPCD. The
problem can also manifest as a probe XC130006 from 
xehExceptionHandler inside an MQOPEN call.

4395 - If memory allocation for internal working storage fails during
an attempt to create a dynamic queue, the LQMA assoicated with
the operation will ABEND, rather than returning a completion
code of 2071 (MQRC_STORAGE_NOT_AVAILABLE). This change resolves
the problem.

4421 - If an attempt to start an OAM server detects an existing OAM
server in the CPU, in prior releases, the FFST generated did not
include the process name. This change amends the FFST to
include the process name of the offending process, where that
name can be determined. 

4428 - The altmqfls command "resetmeasure" was incorrectly documented
in the original version of the SysAdmin guide. See later section
"DOCUMENTATION UPDATES"

4496 - In earlier versions of this readme file, the instructions on 
how to reassign Queue Server for 
SYSTEM.CLUSTER.TRANSMISSION.QUEUE are incorrect. Refer to the
"KNOWN LIMITATIONS, PROBLEMS AND WORKAROUNDS" section for the
correct procedure.

4523 - If an OAM server attempts to start in a CPU, and there is 
already an OAM server registered, prior to V5.3.1.11, the OAM
subsystem reported that there was a rogue process, but not
the name of the process. This change enhances the error
reporting to report the name of the rogue process. 

4726 - Prior to this fixpack, the instmqm script did not check for
saveabend files and FFSTs generated during the validation
phase of the installation. V5.3.1.11 adds this check.

4774 - The cobol binding library, MQMCB, was shipped without symbols in
FixPack V5.3.1.10, which causes applications to fail. V5.3.1.11
resolves this issue. 

4800 - During instmqm, the script checks for the UNIX socket server.
In prior releases, in the event that this check failed, the
error message referred to the old UNIX socket server ($ZPMON).
This has been changed to refer to the new UNIX socket subsystem
$ZLSnn, "nn" is the CPU number.

APAR IC85889 - UNEXPECTED IPC MESSAGES RECEIVED FOLLOWING PROCESS
TERMINATION CAUSE EC TO ABEND REPEATEDLY
If a process sends an unexpected message to the MQECSVR
process pair, the primary process will abend resulting in a
takeover by the backup process. The new primary process will
then abend. The only resolution is to restart the queue manager. 

APAR IC87007 - PRIMARY QUEUE SERVER ABEND FOLLOWING TRANSACTION ABORT
In some circumstances, aborts of global units of work 
involving MQGETs of messages greater than 52k will result in an 
abend of the primary queue server responsible for the queue. 
This renders the queue manager unresponsive 

APAR IC87627 - WEBSPHERE MQ V5.3.1.8 FDC FILES DO NOT CONTAIN ENOUGH ERROR 
INFORMATION

APAR IC89128 - LISTENER FAILS TO START FOLLOWING UPGRADE TO 
HP J06.14/H06.25 OR T9050J01-AWT/T9050H02-AWS
In some configurations, the listener process will not run
following an upgrade to J06.14/H06.25 or the installation of 
T9050J01-AWT/T9050H02-AWS. The failure is dependent on the
number of OSS processes running and their distribution between
the CPUs on the system. This problem also affects endmqlsr.

APAR IC89751 - CLUSSDR Channels do not restart without manual intervention
after CPU crash.
If a CLUSSDR or SDR channel is running in an MCA that is in the 
same CPU as the Primary Channel Server, and that channel has 
been running for at least 5 minutes, and that CPU crashes, the 
channel will not automatically restart. 

APAR IC92511 - TERMINATION OF SLAVE REPOSITORY MANAGER RESULTS IN CLUSTER 
CHANNEL DELETION. In some cases this can result in a manually
stopped cluster sender channel starting unexpectedly when they
are dynamically recreated. 

APAR IC92570 - MULTIPLE CLUSTER RECIEVER CHANNELS OR LONG RUNNING CLUSRCVR 
CHANNELS CAUSE METADATA FDC'S

APAR IC93289 - WEBSPHERE MQ R531 ON HP-NSS CLUSTER PUB SUB MESSAGES FAIL
WITH AMQ9538 - COMMIT CONTROL ERROR 

APAR IC94647 - Closing dynamic queues with MQCO_DELETE or MQCO_DELETE_PURGE
with an outstanding MQGET with signal results in multiple FDCs 
and an orphaned dynamic queue

APAR IC96947 - Backup Queue Server generates "Open handle points to unused 
entry in default page" FFST following LQMA termination 

The following fixes discovered during IBM's development and testing work were
also released with V5.3.1.10:

4607 - Analyze lock logic in queue server takeover does not take account
of temporary dynamic queues
4679 - Exhaustion of message quickcell (MQC) space available to queue 
server results in unstable queue manager
4563 - RDF compatible message overflow file setting requires queue 
manager restart 
4560 - Slave repository managers issue channel manipulation commands 
that should be performed only by the master
4557 - Write NonStop specific trace information to product standard 
trace files rather than platform-specific file
4556 - Internal Queue manager query array size can cause problems 
with clusters containing more than 10 queue managers


The following problems were resolved in FixPack V5.3.1.9:

APAR IC51322 - CODE CHANGES FOR OPTIMIZATION OF DEFAULT CONVERSION
Delay in processing seen during the default conversion between
client and server. The channel attempts normal conversion first,
including attempting to load a conversion table before dropping
through to the default conversion. Once default is required 
for a specific set of code pages, this is now remembered 
and the attempt to perform normal conversion skipped.

APAR IY76799 - A FAILED CALL TO GETPEERNAME RESULTS IN A LEAKED SOCKET FILE
WMQ amqrmppa (channel) process leaks a file descriptor in
the rare circumstance that a call to the getpeername function
fails. Such a failed call is reported in the WMQ error logs for
the queue manager via an AMQ9213 message reporting that the
getpeername call has failed. The failure of
the getpeername call is the result of preoblems external to 
WMQ. This problem could also cause the WMQ listener process
(runmqlsr) to run out of file descriptors, if there is
no queue manager running, and lots of connections come in,
whilst these connections fail with getpeername problems.

APAR IY95706 - SIGSEGV IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING RETURN FROM ZFUDOESOBJECTEXIST
An amqzlga0 process or amqrmppa process will raise an XC130004 
FDC and the amqzlga0 process will end. The abrupt termination of
the amqzlga0/amqrmppa process may cause channels or applications
connected to the queue manager to fail

APAR IZ06131 - RECOVER FROM SYSTEM.AUTH.DATA.QUEUE CORRUPTED BY USER ERROR
Applications receive MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED (2035) error
setmqaut returns MQRC_UNKNOWN_OBJECT_NAME (2085) and fails to
set new authorities. Records are missing from the 
SYSTEM.AUTH.DATA.QUEUE, determined by a mismatch between the 
output from amqoamd -m -s, and the authorities that customers 
believe they have set for users and objects. This fix allows 
recovery from this situation using setmqaut without the need 
to recreate the queue manager 

APAR IC74903 - SSLPeer value slash (/) causes SSL handshake to fail
Using slashes in the Distinguished Name name fields such as CN,
O, OU, L, will fail SSLPEER value verification, and as such SSL
Handshake, due to an MQ parsing error. MQ uses slashes (/) to
delimit the distinguished name values when matching the SSLPEER
value with the information contained in the certificate.

APAR IC82919 - xcsAllocateMemBlock returning xecS_E_NO_MEM
Queue manager (receiver channel side) with API exits generate
FDCs containing probe ZF137003 and error log entries for AMQ9518
in the form of - File '/mqs/WMQtest/var/mqm/@ipcc/AMQRFCDA.DAT'
not found.

APAR IC80942 - Authority commands produced by amqoamd command is not usable if
authorization is "+None"

Using the setmqaut command with commands generated by amqoamd
results in a failure e.g
"setmqaut -m qmgrname -n name -t queue -g group +None"
returns:
"AMQ7097: You gave an authorization specification that is not
valid."

APAR IC81429 - MQRC error 2003 received if an overflow file record is missing
If a portion of a message that should be stored the queue 
overflow file is missing, the generation of an FFST is 
suppressed and a 2003 reason code is returned. All subsequent 
non-specific MQGETs from the queue fail, since the partial 
message cannot be retrieved. 

APAR IC81420 - Queue Server abend during simultaneous GET and BROWSE
When a message larger than 56k is being browsed (MQGET with
one of the MQGMO_BROWSE_* options) from a client application 
using message groups, and another process is simultaneously 
performing a destructive MQGET on the same message. The primary
queue server terminates, and more or more of the following
probes are generated :QS003002, AO211001, AO200002, ZI074001,
NS026006

APAR IC81367 - FixPack 5318 MQMCB Guardian library is not usable
The COBOL wrapper libraries were changed from type LINKFILE to
DLL in the v5.3.1.8 Fixpack, and the packaging unintentionally
stripped the symbols from the Guardian variant of the library
ZWMQBIN.MQMCB. During the link phase of a cobal program build
the following fatal error is encountered:
"Cannot use file specified in CONSULT or SEARCH directive"
Problem affects building in Guardian only.

APAR IC83299 - CPU Failure during mqget of persistent messages in global
unit of work results in incorrectly deleted records in queue and
overflow files

If a CPU fails where multiple applications are performing FIFO
MQGETs from the same queue, and the following conditions are 
true:
* The primary queue server is running in the failing CPU
* Some (but not all) of the applications are running in the
failing CPU
* None of the LQMAs are running in the failing CPU
* The applications are using global units of work
* Applications in the failing CPU have completed MQGET operations
but not committed the transactions
There is a failure window where an application not in the
failing CPU will remove an additional message record from the 
queue file.

APAR IC83197 - Queue Server open handle management cannot handle backup
restart cases where handles from non-contiguous pages are 
synced by the primary

Queue servers with more than 3000 queue opens do not 
correctly handle a NonStop takeover. The queue manager becomes 
unresponsive and requires a restart to resolve the error 
situation. When the queue server hangs, the backup queue server
produces a large number of FFST entries with the following 
probe ids:
QS165004 from qslSetHandle
QS192007 from qslAddOpener
QS190005 from qslHandleOpen

APAR IC83569 - Persistent Reference messages sent over a channel cause Commit 
Control Error

When a persistent reference message is put to a queue, FFST's
with probe CS075003 are generated with the following error 
information
Major Errorcode :- rrcE_COMMIT_CONTROL_ERROR
Minor Errorcode :- OK
Comment1 :- Error 2232 returned from lpiSPIHPNSSTxInfo
In addition, Sender channels will go into a retry state and
queue manager error logs will contain 'Commit Control' errors

APAR IC83699 - Cluster cache maintenance asynchronous time values result in
cache content divergence

Repository queue managers report FFST with probe RM527002
from rrmHPNSSGetMetaPacket and Comment1 field 
"Meta data mis-match Expected: metalen=4". The problem 
resolved by this APAR is one of several possible causes of
these symptoms.

APAR IC83328 - Permanent dynamic queues are not deleted in some cases when
MQCO_DELETE is used on MQCLOSE.
Permanent dynamic queues are not deleted as expected after 
termination of the last application that has the queue open.

APAR IC83228 - Repository manager/Channel server deadlock
Listener process hangs on queue manager startup for 5 
minutes then generates an FFST with probe RM264002 
from rfxConnectCache
Comment1 :- Gave up waiting for cache to be initialized
Comment2 :- Tried 300 times at 1 second intervals. 
This problem also occurs sometimes when attempting
to use runmqsc while the queue manager is starting

APAR IY90524 - segv in xcsloadfunction for channel exit
WebSphere MQ channel process (amqrmppa) terminates with FFST
showing probe id XC130003 due to a SIGSEGV SIGNAL with
a function stack as follows:
MQM Function Stack
ccxResponder
rrxResponder
rriAcceptSess
rriInitExits
xcsLoadFunction

APAR IC81311 - MQGET implementation masks reason codes in some cases
Attempting to perform an MQGET after a Local Queue Manager
Agent (LQMA) process fails or has been forcibly terminated
results in a MQRC_UNEXPECTED_ERROR (2195). This is incorrect.
The result should be MQRC_CONNECTON_BROKEN (2009)

The following fixes discovered during IBM's development and testing work were
also released with V5.3.1.9:

4363 - MQA process opener field is sometimes corrupted in MQGET with 
set signal operations
4388 - Guardian sample uses the wrong link directive
4339 - Shared hconn rendered unsuable by changes in 5317
4123 - FASTPATH bound connect processing does not correctly set reason
codes in some cases
4039 - Backup queue server abend during commit after MQGET
3826 - altmqfls --qsize does not report failure correctly
4116 - enhance SDCP to find installed version of OSSLS2 (T8620)

The following problems were resolved in FixPack V5.3.1.8:

APAR IC54121 - Cluster channel in a retrying state will no longer start 
automatically if the following commands are issued 
STOP CHANNEL() MODE(QUIESCE) STATUS(INACTIVE).
The channel will fail to start once communication
to the remote system is restored. A manual start and
stop of the channel is required to restore normal
channel operation

APAR IC54459 - Channel stays in binding state for a long time when it contains
an invalid conname value. During this period, all requests to 
the channel are ignored.

APAR IC60204 - Comamnd server experiences a memory leak when namelist
inquireies are performed with names values.
The leak is observed when a PCF MQCMD_INQUIRE_NAMELIST or
MQCMD_INQUIRE_NAMELIST_NAMES is requested that has one or 
more names attributes.

APAR IC70168 - High CPU usage from backup Queue Server performing browse
operations on queues with high queue depth.
When a queue has a very high queue depth (CURDEPTH) a browse
can cause the cpu usage of the backup Queue Server to increase
to 100%. Backup queue server CPU usage becomes significant at
a queue depth of 15000, with CPU use reaching 100% at a queue
depth of approx. 38000 messages.

APAR IC70947 - qmproc.ini file validation does not detect incorrect CPU syntax.
CPU lists in the qmproc.ini file that do not use comma
characters to separate CPU numbers in the list are ignored, but
they are not reported as an error. This can lead to unexpected
CPU assignements for WMQ processes.

APAR IC71839 - RESET QUEUE STATISTICS PCF returns incorrect values.
When using WebSphere MQ v5.3 for HP NonStop Server PCF command
Reset Queue Statistics, intermittently some of the values
associated with a queue will not be returned correctly.
* HighQDepth - The maximum number of messages on the queue
since the statistics were last reset.
(parameter identifier: MQIA_HIGH_Q_DEPTH).
* MsgEnqCount - The number of messages enqueued (the number of
MQPUT calls to the queue), since the
statistics were last reset.
(parameter identifier: MQIA_MSG_ENQ_COUNT).
* MsgDeqCount - The number of messages dequeued (the number of
MQGET calls to the queue), since the
statistics were last reset.
(parameter identifier: MQIA_MSG_DEQ_COUNT).

Incorrect values may also be returned incorrectly for the
command Inquire Queue Status
* LastGetTime - Time at which the last message was
destructively read from the queue
(parameter identifier: MQCACF_LAST_GET_TIME).
* LastPutTime - Time at which the last message was
successfully put to the queue
(parameter identifier: MQCACF_LAST_PUT_TIME).

APAR IC71912 - MQMC Channel menu display shows incorrect channel status.
In some instances, the MQMC Channel Menu display will not
show a change in channel status, and attempts to refresh the
screen or recycle the MQS-MQMSVR Pathway server do not correct
the problem. RUNMQSC continues to show the correct status. 
The MQMC channel monitor panel does show the running channels
correctly.

APAR IC73800 - A queue manager with the MaxUnthreadeAgents parameter defined
in the QMPROC.INI file with a value greater than 812
reports unexpected process termination FDCs and or ERROR 22
FDCs.

APAR IC74994 - Queue manager reports message sequence number error and
produces FDCs with probe CS094005, major error code
rrcE_CREATE_SYNC_FAILED following a queue manager
restart. 

APAR IC75298 - In some complex cluster configuations with large numbers of
cluster members, large numbers of objects, or frequent changes
to cluster objects, the repository managers in a queue
manager are unable to distribute a complete set of object 
metadata information, resulting in repeated FDCs from 
rrmHPNSSGetMetaPacket, with probe RM527001, and cluster objects
not being visible in some CPUs in the queue manager reporting the
problems.

The fix for the problem adds a new configurable parameter to
allow the repository metadata buffers to be increased to handle
larger configurations, and changes the reporting of the metadata
errors to include information on the amount of storage requested
by the repository managers. The default size of the buffer is 
512K, this is sufficient for most configurations. If the buffer 
size is insufficient, the queue manager reports FDCs from 
rrmHPNSSPutMetaPacket that indicate the present size of the
buffer and the size demanded.

The buffer size is configured using an environment variable, 
AMQ_CLUSTER_METABUFFER_KILOBYTES. To change the value, the 
environment variable should be specified in the 
"RepositoryManager" stanza of the qmproc.ini file of the queue
manager using the following syntax:

Env0n=AMQ_CLUSTER_METABUFFER_KILOBYTES=x

Where "n" is the number of the environment variable, and "x" is
the required new size of the buffer in kilobytes. In a default
configuration, environment variables are not present in the 
RepositoryManager stanza, hence "n" will be 1. If the 
configuration has existing environment variables specified in
this stanza, the value of "n" selected should be the next 
available value. 

APAR IC75356 - Partial repository queue managers in complex configurations
where applications connected to the partial repository queue
manager attempt to open large numbers of nonexistant objects
can suffer from a build up of subscription objects on the 
SYSTEM.CLUSTER.REPOSITORY.QUEUE such that the TMF lock limits
for the volume containing the queue file are breached when the
queue is reconciled. This produces 2024 errors during operations
on the SYSTEM.CLUSTER.REPOSITORY.QUEUE The following error 
message appears in the QMgr error logs.
EXPLANATION: The attempt to get messages from queue
'SYSTEM.CLUSTER.REPOSITORY.QUEUE' on queue manager 'xxx' failed 

APAR IY57123 - Attempts to put to a clustered queue via a queue manager
alias when the queue has been opened using BIND_AS_QDEF
fail. Following this fix, queue name resolution functions
as described in the Application Programming Guide.

APAR IY78473 - Cluster workload management is not invoked if a queue is
resolved using clustered queue manager aliases where there
are multiple instances of the alias in the cluster.

APAR IY86606 - Cluster subscriptions are created for non-clustered queues
when MQOPEN is called with non-clustered ReplyToQ or 
ReplyToQMgr. This can result in a build up of subscriptions
in partial repositories in the cluster. The error was 
introduced by IY8473.

APAR IZ14977 - Queue manager cluster membership missing when namelists are
used to add and remove queue managers from clusters. This can
result in the queue manager not acting as a repository for
one or more clusters, or other queue managers in the cluster
not recognizing that a given queue manager is a repository
for the cluster.

APAR IZ20546 - The repository manager process (amqrrmfa) consumes high CPU
resources on an hourly basis for several minutes, and
applications are unable to issue messaging MQ API calls
during this period. The problem is observed only in 
configurations where clustered queue manager aliases are
used and they resolve to more than 50 destinations.

The following fixes discovered during IBM's development and testing work were
also released with V5.3.1.8:

1228 - COBOL Binding library mqmcb does not contain VPROC information
1378 - FDC's cut as a result of errors from PATHWAY SPI operations do
not report the associated Guardian error code 
1566 - WMQ service installation tool svcmqm does not correctly detect
and report that files it is attempting to modify are in use,
as is the case where WMQ applications are still runnning. 
1606 - Certain FDCs containing comment text have the comment text
truncated 
1710 - In some cases on heavily loaded systems, the EC re-allocates
an MCA that has already been told to terminate. This results in
FDC's cut with probe EC134000, from eclDeallocMCA.
2534 - WMQ service installation tool svcmqm does not log some aspects
of its progress, making diagnosing some installation problems
difficult
2856 - WMQ service installation tool should not attempt SECURE
operations in installations where SAFEGUARD is enabled
2943 - crtmqm does not correctly handle validation of the command line
if a specified CPU number is invalid
3037 - If the var/mqm/errors directory contains non-mqm user files 
the WMQ service data collection tool, sdcp, does not capture the 
MQM group FDC and ZZSA files.
3128 - WMQ Service data collection tool, sdcp, does not capture VPROC 
of the AF_UNIX R2 socket process


The following changes were released in FixPack V5.3.1.7:

APAR IC65774 - Under given conditions, the response time measured for MQGET
operations when using SSL activated channels with multi-threaded
MCA agents are found to be longer than that measured when using 
SSL activated channels with unthreaded MCA agents. This problem 
is seen with both distributed and cluster queue managers. 
Moreover, this problem does not occur prior to WMQ V5.3.1.5 
release. A DELAY was introduced as part of an APAR(IC57744) fix
in WMQ V5.3.1.5 release for mutli-threaded SSL channels which
caused this difference in measured response time. The problem is
now rectified in this release. 

APAR IC67032 - Improvement to LQMA FDC during MQCONN processing. At times, when
application dies during MQCONN processing, LQMA's generate FDCs
for this rather unusual event to let the user take any 
corrective action and/or find the root cause. The problem can 
occur with a standard bound application in a very narrow timing
window when the application connects with the LQMA agent but 
dies before the LQMA gets a chance to read the incoming message
from the application. When LQMA detects this situation, it 
cleans up and generates an FDC. But unfortunately, the FDC does
not contain the application information. To let the user 
identify the mis-behaving application and to possibly take
corrective action, LQMA FDC will be updated to include 
application information. The updated FDC will contain the
following information :

Comment1 :- Application died during MQCONN Processing.
Comment2 :- Application: <Application PID> 

APAR IC67057 - Unused LQMA agents(processes or threads) are found during MQCONN 
processing. During MQCONN processing if a standard bound 
application fails to connect successfully to an allocated LQMA
process or thread (depending on your configuration), then that
LQMA process or thread remains in a hanging state for ever and
do not get re-used by Execution Controller for any further 
MQCONN processing. If an LQMA agent process ever goes into this 
"limbo" state, ecasvc utility shows 
"Allocated, Pending Registration" flag if it is unthreaded LQMA 
or a positive number against "Conns Pending" flag if it is a 
multi threaded LQMA. If this problem occurrs multiple times, 
then depending on the user configuration, it might lead to LQMA 
resource problems where Execution Controller will run out of 
available LQMA agents to serve application MQCONN requests.

APAR IC65966 - runmqsc <queue manager name> causes FDC on a CPU due to missing
OSS shared memory files (shm.x.x) for that CPU. Due to a yet
unknown reason, the queue manager shared memory files for a
particular CPU on the system are deleted even when the queue
manager is in running state. This prevents any new MQ connection
requests from succeeding for the same queue manager on the
affected CPU. This patch contains changes that will better
protect WMQ shared memory files and will prevent accidental
deletion of files by WMQ programs. The changes in this patch
will also report any such incidence by producing FDC files. The
FDC file produced by this detection mechanism will contain the
following information :
Comment1 :- xcsIC_QUEUE_MANAGER_POOL being destroyed.

APAR IC67569 - When WMQ Queue Server detects an error due to invalid context
data during the completion of a TMF transaction started by the
Queue Server for a PUT or GET no-syncpoint persistent message
operation, it marks the message on the queue object as 
accessible. This causes the Queue Server to FDC with 
"Record not found" on any subsequent MQGET operation to retrieve
the same message. The particular message on the queue that has 
this problem remains in this limbo state forever and can not be
retrieved. However other messages on the same queue that do not
have this problem can be retrieved without any problem using 
their msgids. The Queue Server has been revised to correct this
behavior such that detection of inconsistent context data during
MQPUT/MQGET is logged in the form of an FDC but is otherwise 
committed as a normal operation. This will resolve the problem
of MQGET failing on the retrieval of the message.

APAR IC68569 - Channel server FDCs during starting/stopping of channels. The 
problem occurrs due to a defect in the product where the channel
server erroneously closes its open to Queue Server but assumes 
that its open to Queue Server is valid. The open handle 
to Queue Server after it is closed, gets reused by another open
and hence any subsequent communication by Channel Server to 
Queue Server always fails. Typically, this problem is seen when
the Channel Server experiences transient socket errors with the 
channel agent (MCA) and it wants to close the socket connection.
After closing the socket connection, Channel server sends a 
message to Execute Controller process to de-allocate the MCA
with which it had socket error with. It is during this 
communication between the Channel Server and the Execution
Controller when the Channel Server erroneously closes the open
to the Queue Server.

APAR IC69572 - Channel server abends due to illegal address reference during
adopt MCA processing. This problem happens if the Queue Manager
has enabled adopt MCA processing to a remote WMQ Queue Manager
that does not send a remote queue manager name during channel
initialization/negotiation. The remote Queue Manager field
remains NULL and during the Adopt MCA processing logic,
the channel server incorrectly references the NULL pointer and
abends. 

APAR IC69932 - SNA WMQ listener fails to start the channel when HP SPR 
T9055H07^AGN is present on the NonStop system. HP, in its SPR
SPR T9055H07^AGN, changed the behavior of sendmsg() API if '-1'
is used as a file descriptor to the API. This caused 
incompatibility with WMQ SNA listener process. WMQ code has now 
been revised to work with the updated sendmsg() behavior. 

APAR IC69996 - WMQ Queue Server generates FDC with reply error 74. When an
application with a waiting syncpoint MQGET suddenly dies 
before getting a reply, the Queue Server can cause FDC 
sometimes. This happens in a narrow timing window when a message
becomes available on the queue and the Queue Server starts 
processing the waiting MQGET request. If the application dies
after Queue Server starts processing the waiting MQGET request, 
then Queue Server detects the inherited TMF transaction error 
and replies back with error 2072 (MQRC_SYNCPOINT_NOT_AVAILABLE).
However in this case, Queue Server erroneously does not delete
its internal waiter record for MQGET. When the timer pops for
the waiter record, Queue Server attempts to reply back with
no message available but the call to Guardian REPLYX procedure
fails with error 74 as the reply to the same request has already
been made(with error MQRC_SYNCPOINT_NOT_AVAILABLE). This causes
the Queue Server to FDC.

The following fixes discovered during IBM's development and testing work were
also released with V5.3.1.7:

363 - WMQ Queue Server under certain conditions fails to handle non-persistent
and persistent segmented messages at the same time.
1317 - Support for parallel execution of multiple endmqm programs on the same
Queue Manager. 
1404 - MQGET WAIT is not being rejected with error 2069 when there is an 
existing MQGET set signal on the same queue handle. 
1434 - svcmqm utility fails when install files are open but does not tell the 
user which files are open. 
1566 - svcmqm does not exit immediately when 'cp' command fails to copy 
binaries during fixpack installation.
1679 - WMQ Queue Server generates FDC while failing to open the message 
overflow file during retrieval of very large messages (equal to or 
larger than 'Message Overflow Threshold' displayed with dspmqfls 
utility).
1709 - instmqm changes related to the use of /opt directory for the creation of
backup archive file.

and Queue Manager cache status remain in STARTING state.
1780 - Port of distributed APAR IY85542. RESET CLUSTER command does not remove 
deleted repository entry.
1993 - Enhancement to WMQ mqrc program to print messages related to errors 
being returned on NonStop platform.
2018 - WMQ lqma agent process leaks catalog file open.
2181 - svcmqm does not output the fixpack that is being installed.

2290 - Enhancement to Execution Controller process to aid development dubugging
and troubleshooting.
2534 - svcmqm has no log of its progress.
2580 - Potential SEGV in internal function call during Pathway serverclass

2632 - Incorrect message output in FDC generated by WMQ Queue Server during 
nsrReply function call.
2633 - WMQ Command Server memory leak found in CLEAR QL command.
2842 - WMQ Repman process priority was not set correctly when the 
qmproc.ini 'AllProcesses' stanza Priority attribute is configured. 

The following serviceability fixes were made to the SDCP tool:

1971 - sdcp data was not collected correctly when there is a default 
Queue Manager defined.
2211 - sdcp testing of the permission of /tmp directory.
2289 - sdcp logging of progress to a file to aid in sdcp problem diagnosis.
2298 - sdcp performance improvement.
2531 - sdcp logging of scheduled CPU information.
2582 - sdcp capture of Pathway data for PATHMON, PATHWAY, TCP, PROGRAM
and TERM attributes.

The following APAR fixes were released in V5.3.1.6:

APAR IC60204 - A Memory leak occurs with repeated DISPLAY NAMELIST command. The
leak is observed only when the NAMELIST(s) has one or more NAMES
values defined. The problem is observed from within the runmqsc
DISPLAY NAMELIST command, or from the PCF/MQIA equivalent. Tools
that request NAMELIST data via the command server with PCF/MQIA
requests such as WMQ Explorer will cause the WMQ command server
memory to grow.

APAR IC61324 - An orphan MCA problem occurs when a connection request from WMQ
LISTENER or CHANNEL SERVER process to an MCA process fails. WMQ
Execution Controller (EC) process fails to recognize the
situation and does not re-use the MCA process for future agent
allocation requests. Over a period of time, this problem can
cause the queue manager to run out of MCA resources which may
lead to a situation where no new channel can be started. The
problem is observed during heavy load conditions where the WMQ
Execution Controller(EC) process hands over a selected MCA
process to LISTENER/CHANNEL SERVER before the MCA process
becomes ready to accept connection requests.

APAR IC61551 - The use of cluster administrative command
RESET CLUSTER ACTION(FORCEREMOVE), to forcibly remove a Queue
Manager out of the cluster can cause FDCs. The problem can cause
multiple FDCs and sometimes abend in WMQ REPMAN process in a
slave role. Once the command has been issued and the error has
occurred, the concerned Queue Manager must be restarted to
restore the clustering function to normal operation. The problem
occurs because WMQ REPMAN process in a master role does not
distribute the RESET CLUSTER ACTION(FORCEREMOVE) command to the
slave REPMAN processes correctly.

APAR IC61651 - When a NAMELIST object with one or more NAMES values is defined
for a Queue Manager and a dspmqfls command is issued to retrieve
the details of either all objects under the Queue Manager or
the specific NAMELIST object, FDCs are seen from the WMQ LQMA
process. The problem exists for both unthreaded and
multi-threaded LQMA process. The problem occurs because WMQ LQMA
process does not allocate sufficient memory for NAMES buffer
during dspmqfls processing.

APAR IC61660 - A PCF RESET QUEUE STATISTICS command causes the WMQ QUEUE SERVER
process to FDC. The problem occurs during a timing window when
there is an outstanding unit of work on the queue and a
RESET QUEUE STATISTICS command is processed and then the
outstanding unit of work is backed out. RESET QUEUE STATISTICS
causes certain internal counters inside WMQ QUEUE SERVER to be
reset to zero without taking into account the outstanding unit
of work. If the outstanding work is later backed out for any
reason, the already reset counters become negative which causes
an internal consistency check to fail within the QUEUE SERVER
process and the FDC is generated.

APAR IC61681 - WMQ QUEUE SERVER causes FDC during MQCLOSE processing on a
cluster alias queue. The problem occurs during MQCLOSE
processing of a cluster QALIAS object hosted by a different
QUEUE SERVER than that hosts the target local queue. MQOPEN
incorrectly failed to allocate an internal handle for the QALIAS
object if it was a cluster alias queue. This lead to the FDC
during MQCLOSE processing.

APAR IC61846 - When a START CHANNEL command is issued after WMQ trace is
enabled, the SSL channel logs a Queue Manager error message and
fails to start.
The problem exists only for a SSL channel, no such problem
is found for regular (non-SSL) channel. The problem occurs
because of an incorrect implementation of NULL terminated string
to store SSL Cipher data.

APAR IC61920 - WMQ on NonStop reports an extra EMS message when the generation
of an FFST is reported.
The intention behind the second EMS message was to report the
case when the open of the generated FFST file fails but the
check to see the status of the opened FFST files was missing
in the code.

APAR IC62341 - A Security error from the WMQ OAM server is not propagated
correctly. It was reported as MQRC_UNKNOWN_OBJECT_NAME instead
of MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED. When running the Java IVP (MQIVP) to NSK
with a non-mqm user specified as the MCAUSER in the SVRCONN
channel, and if the non-mqm group isn't given authorization,
MQIVP fails to connect to the Queue Manager
with an authorization failure (MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED) but it is
reported incorrectly as a MQRC_UNKNOWN_OBJECT_NAME error.

APAR IC62389 - A REFRESH CLUSTER command within a cluster with more than two
repositories causes the Repository Manager to fail. The problem
is not common in normal cluster operation but is likely if
extensive administrative changes are being made to the cluster
that includes a REFRESH CLUSTER command. Incorrect distribution
of channel status information across multiple copies of the
REPOSITORY MANAGER cache in different CPUs of the system lead to
the FDC.

APAR IC62391 - Sometimes cluster queues are not visible on CPUs hosting WMQ
REPOSITORY MANAGER process in a slave role. This is a cluster
queue visibility problem across the CPUs. Any attempt to open
the cluster queue on CPUs that have the visibility problem
results in error MQRC_UNKNOWN_OBJECT_NAME or
MQRC_CLUSTER_RESOLUTION_ERROR.
The problem does not occur on the CPU that hosts WMQ REPOSITORY
MANAGER process in a master role.

APAR IC62449 - The WMQ QUEUE SERVER does not log storage related problems to
the Queue Manager log. Some of NSK storage related errors like
error 43 and error 45 are useful errors for which corrective
action can be taken to restore normal operation.
The WMQ QUEUE SERVER now logs these errors to Queue Manager log.

APAR IC62480 - Port of IZ51686. Incorrect cache object linkage causes
unexpected failures (AMQ9456) based on coincidental event
sequences.

APAR IC62511 - Port of the following clustering-related APARs from other
platforms and versions:
IZ14399 - Queue managers successfully rejoin a cluster when
APAR IY99051 is applied but have mismatching sequence
numbers for the cluster queue manager object and its
associated clusters.
IZ21977 - MQRC_OBJECT_CHANGED(2041),
AMQ9511 SYSTEM.CLUSTER.TRANSMIT.QUEUE,AMQ9448,
Repository manager ends.
IZ37511 - Generation of an FDC by the Repository Manager causes
it to terminate.
IZ14977 - Missing cluster information when Namelists are used
to add and remove queue managers from multiple
clusters at once.
IZ36482 - Changes to CLUSRCVR shared using a Namelist not
published to all clusters.
IZ10757 - Repository Manager process terminates with error
RRCI_CLUS_NO_CLUSRCVR_DEFINED.
IZ41187 - MQRC_CLUSTER_PUT_INHIBITED was returned when an out-
dated object definition from the cluster repository
was referenced.
IZ34125 - MQ fails to construct and send an availability message
when REFRESH CLUSTER REPOS (YES) is issued on a queue
manager with more than 1 CLUSRCVR.
96181 - Object changed problems with the Repository manager.
IY97159 - Repository Manager process tries to access the cache
while restoring the cache, resulting in a hang.
IZ44552 - AMQ9430 message after REFRESH CLUSTER.
135969 - Refresh bit not set when demoting QM to partial repository.

APAR IC62850 - The md.Priority of a message was not being set to the queue
DEFPRTY when a no syncpoint MQPUT is performed using
MQPRI_PRIORITY_AS_Q_DEF while there is a waiting MQGET.
A syncpoint MQPUT with a waiting MQGET does not have this
problem.

APAR IC63081 - A WMQ application abends in the MQI library when attempting to
enqueue messages to a Distribution LIST with one queue entry.
Also in certain circumstances, WMQ applications may receive
incorrect status and reason code while using Distribution LISTS.

APAR IC63105 - A Memory leak occurs in the WMQ COMMAND SERVER with repeated
DISPLAY QSTATUS command. The leak is observed only when
TYPE HANDLE is used with the above command. The problem also
occurs from within runmqsc DISPLAY QSTATUS command, or from the
PCF/MQIA equivalent. Tools that request queue status data via
WMQ COMMAND SERVER with PCF/MQIA requests such as WMQ Explorer
will cause the WMQ COMMAND SERVER memory to grow.

APAR IC63271 - When an MQ application delays in replying to the HP system OPEN
message from the WMQ QUEUE SERVER and an MQ message arrives on
queue during this period, the MQ message did not get delivered
even after the reply to the HP system OPEN message is made.

APAR IC63757 - In a standard bound application, a memory leak occurs in WMQ
LQMA process during MQCONN/MQDISC processing. The problem occurs
with both unthreaded and multi-threaded LQMA process. If the
LQMA agents are configured to have high use count
(MaxAgentUse for unthreaded LQMA and MaxThreadedAgentUse for
multi-threaded LQMA) and WMQ Execution Controller process
re-uses the same LQMA process to satisfy a application MQCONN
request, then the heap memory of LQMA process grows even if
application calls MQDISC to disconnect from the
Queue Manager.

APAR IC64297 - WMQ Queue Manager becomes non-responsive because the
WMQ QUEUE SERVER does not clean up the internal queue manager
object opens. The QUEUE SERVER internal links for
MQOPEN of the Queue Manager object were not
being released during the MQCLOSE processing. This causes a
buildup of QUEUE SERVER memory as the application repeated
MQOPEN of the queue manager object repeatedly. When either
a MQDISC occurred or the application process ended,
the QUEUE SERVER cleans up its internal lists for the process.
This resulted in a perceived QUEUE SERVER loop and
non-responsive WMQ as there were
over 246,000 opens found of the Queue Manager object with a
high mark of 548,000 within the QUEUE SERVER when a dump of the
Queue Server was analyzed.
MQOPEN of other MQ objects (qlocal, qalias, qremote etc.) do not
have this issue.

APAR IC64373 - The COBOL copybook now includes missing definitions for MQGET
SET SIGNAL processing.

APAR IC64435 - An incorrect persistence attribute was being set for a
non-persistent message on XMIT queue. When MQPUT of a
non-persistent message is done using MQPER_PERSISTENCE_AS_Q_DEF
attribute to a remote queue while the channel is idle, the MD
MD data in transmit queue header contained
MQPER_PERSISTENCE_AS_Q_DEF value of (2).

APAR IC64630 - It takes longer for unthreaded SSL sender channel to end when
communication to the remote Queue Manager is lost. The problem
occurs because the unthreaded MCA process running the SSL channel
fails to timeout correctly causing the channel to end differently
than non-SSL channels. The problem is observed only with SSL
channels and no such problem is visible with regular SSL 
channels. 

The following fixes discovered during IBM's development and testing work are
also released with V5.3.1.6:

1096 - An MQGET BROWSE operation can return prematurely with no message
available as well as can cause a waited GET to hang indefinitely.
1513 - amqrrmit erroneously reports multiple master REPMAN processes.
1587 - Enhancements to Execution Controller log messages pertaining to
Threshold and MaxAgent capacity situations. For unthreaded agents,
the "max unthreaded agents reached" message will now be logged when the
MaxUnthreadedAgent is allocated to perform work. In previous releases,
the message was logged when the MaxUnthreadedAgent was added to the idle
pool, which actually left one agent still available for use.
For threaded agents, messages have been enhanced to display separate
Threshold/Maximum messages for agents and threads. In previous releases,
"further connections refused" was displayed when the MaxThreadedAgent
was started, which actually left MaximumThreads connections still
available for use. In this release "further connections refused" will be
displayed when the MaximumThread is allocated for use.
Also in this release, messages will be logged when the number of agents
or threads, after having exceeded the threshold or reached maximum,
fall below the Maximum or threshold limit.
1669 - ZCG_FFST does not report the error code for a TMF error.
1675 - The Execution Controller now provides an API to mark MCAs that are no
longer used.
1670 - Correction to missing component data in a FDC generated by the
Queue Manager server(MQS-QMGRSVR00) process(amqqmsvr).
1678 - Queue server abends due to uninitialized FFST inserts.
1706 - dmpmqaut -m <qmgr> sometimes only reports the first QALIAS object and
FDCs in kpiEnumerateObjectAuthority.
1710 - The Execution Controller sometimes allocates an MCA that it has
previously asked to end
1712 - Cluster queue manager STATUS and queue visibility problems in slave
REPMAN.
1734 - Fixes/Updates to MQ tracing mechanism.
1735 - Subscription id distribution.
1751 - Fixes/Updates to MQ tracing mechanism.
1807 - Changes to improve service and debug capability of Execution Controller
started processes.
1873 - "*" subscriptions are generated incorrectly causing them to be ignored.
1989 - Fix for channel server hanging problem while opening REPMAN process.
2003 - LQMA now FDCs when a invalid message is received.

The following serviceability fixes were made to the SDCP tool:

1659 - sdcp is not capturing the PSTATE of backup processes.
1676 - sdcp takes too long.
1690 - sdcp MQ utilities are not using the correct Queue Manager name if
the name is mangled because of non-alphabetic characters.
1702 - sdcp doesn't collect all relevant Saveabend files.
1705 - sdcp workaround to avoid APAR IC61651.
1971 - sdcp now gives correct output for default Queue Manager.

The following APAR fixes were released in V5.3.1.5:

APAR IC55607 - FDC files can fail to be written, or written to the wrong file
FDCs can be suppressed or overwritten when application processes
raise FDCs under User IDs that are not members of the MQM group.
In addition, because FDC files are named with the CPU and PIN of
the generating process, and PIN is reused frequently on
HP NonStop Server, FDCs from different processes can be appended
to the same file.

The format of the file name for FDCs is:
AMQcccpppp.s.FDC

where ccc is the CPU number
pppp is the PIN
s is the sequence number

In V5.3.1.4 and earlier releases, the sequence number was
always set to 0. This fix introduces the use of the sequence
number field to ensure that FDCs from different processes are
always written to different files, and that FDCs can always be
written. FDC files are created with file
permissions "rw-r----" to prevent unauthorized access to the
FDC data.

APAR IC57435 - Attempts to end a queue manager with either -t or -p following
a cpu failure in some cases did not work as a result of
damage to the WMQ OSS shared memory files. The shared memory
management code was revised to tolerate OSS shmem/shm files
containing invalid data. Invalid data in these files is now
ignored and memory segment creation will continue normally.

APAR IC58165 - Triggered channels sometimes do not trigger when they should
Some attributes of a local queue that determine if trigger
messages get generated are not kept up to date for long-running
applications. The most critical attribute is the GET attribute
that controls whether MQGET operations are enabled for a queue
or not. If the application opened the triggered queue while
the queue was GET(DISABLED), and the queue is subsequently
modified to be GET(ENABLED), triggering will not occur when it
should.

APAR IC58377 - Trace data is not written when PIDs are reused for processes
running under different User IDs.
Trace files are named according to the CPU and PIN of the process
that is being traced. On HP NonStop Server, since PINs are
rapidly reused, it is likely that a process attempting to write
trace data will encounter an existing file written with the same
CPU and PIN. The traced process will be unable to write data if
the original file was written (and therefore owned) by a
different User ID.

This fix introduces a sequence number into the trace file names
to prevent trace file name collisions.

The format of trace file names will change from:

AMQccppppp.TRC to AMQccppppp.s.TRC

where s is a sequence number that will usually be 0.
Trace files are now created with file permissions "rw-r----"
to prevent unauthorized access to the trace data.

APAR IC58717 - The Queue Server backup process generates FDCs showing ProbeId
QS123006 from qslHandleChpPBC when attempting to locate a browse
cursor message, with the comment text of
"Error locating Last Message in Browse Cursor checkpoint in
Backup" or "Error locating Last Logical Message in Browse Cursor
checkpoint in Backup". The problem appears only when running a
number of parallel browse / get applications for the same queue
object.

APAR IC58792 - strmqm fails to delete orphaned temporary dynamic queues if the
associated touch file is missing. This results in these queues
remaining in the object catalog indefinitely, and FDC files
being generated each time the queue manager is started,
reflecting the fact that the queue could not be deleted. The
housekeeping function was modified to always silently remove
temporary dynamic queue objects from the catalog, whether or
not they are damaged. FDC files are no longer generated.

APAR IC58859 - wmqtrig script does not pass TMC with ENVRDATA correctly.
If ENVRDATA is part of the PROCESS definiton used by
runmqtrm to trigger applications the TMC is not delivered to
the application correctly. The problem does not occur with
blank ENVRDATA. Additionally, ENVRDATA or USERDATA attributes
that contain volume names ($DATA for example) are not processed
correctly by the wmqtrig script.

APAR IC58891 - Sender channels that were running in a CPU that failed are not
restarted in some circumstances. Sender channels that are not
restarted report "AMQ9604: Channel <...> terminated
unexpectedly" in the queue manager error log, and the channel
server create FDCs with ProbeID RM487001, Component
"rriChannelTerminate".

APAR IC58976 - A server channel without a specified CONNAME enters a STOPPED
state when the MCA process running the channel is forcibly
stopped or ends following a CPU failure. The channel state
should be set to INACTIVE following this type of event. To
recover the situation the channel has to be manually restarted
or stopped using MODE(INACTIVE).

APAR IC59024 - The copyright data in the COBOL COPYBOOK CMQGMOL file
is incorrect.

APAR IC59126 - Context data is missing in COA message.
When an MQPUT application sends a message with COA report
option, the generated replied COA message does not contain
context data eg. PutDate, PutTime, etc.

APAR IC59364 - Queue Server primary incorrectly commits an WMQ message in
certain cases where the backup process has failed to process
an internal checkpoint message. This causes an inconsistency
between the primary and backup processes when an MQGET is
attempted on this message, resulting in FDCs with the comment
text "Invalid Message Header context in Backup for Get" from
Component "qslHandleGetCkp". The queue object is no longer
accessible via MQGETs, but can be recovered by stopping the
backup process.

APAR IC59388 - V5.3 OAM Implementation contains migration logic which may be
triggered erroneously in some circumtances, removing authority
records from the SYSTEM.AUTH.DATA.QUEUE. This change removes the
migration logic, since there are no previous versions of the
OAM which require migration.

APAR IC59395 - Threaded LQMA actual usage is one larger than the configured
maximum use count in the qmproc.ini file. Unthreaded LQMAs
and MCAs (both threaded and unthreaded) do not suffer from this
problem.

APAR IC59428 - In some circumstances where connecting applications terminate
unexpectedly during the MQCONN processing, either by external
forcible termination, or as a consequence of other failures that

result in termination, the resulting error can cause the LQMA
process handling the application to terminate. This will
cause collateral disconnections of all other applications using
the same LQMA, with the application experiencing either a 2009
(connection broken) or 2295 (unexpected) error. The problem
window occurs only during one section of the connect protocol
and has been observed only on very busy systems with repeated
multiple forced terminations of applications.

APAR IC59742 - qmproc.ini file will fail validation if configured with both
MinIdleAgents=0 and MaxIdleAgents=0.

APAR IC59743 - Queue Manager server expiration report generation is not fully
configurable. The frequency with which the queue manager server
generates expiration reports is configurable but the number of
reports generated is not. This change introduces a new
environment variable (MQQMSMAXMSGSEXPIRE), to allow
configuration of the number of expiration reports generated
at any one time. The parameter can be added to the WMQ
Pathway MQS-QMGRSVR00 serverclass:
ALTER MQS-QMGRSVR00, ENV MQQMSMAXMSGSEXPIRE=<1-99999>
If this value is not specified in the queue manager
serverclass configuration, the value defaults to 100.

APAR IC59802 - Memory leak occurs with repeated DIS CHSTATUS SAVED command.
A memory leak exists in the Channel Saved Status query. This
leak is observed within either the runqmsc DISPLAY CHSTATUS

SAVED command, or the PCF/MQIA equivalent. Tools that request
saved channel status data via the Command Server with PCF / MQIA
requests such as WMQ Explorer will cause the Command Server
memory to grow.

APAR IC60114 - WMQ processes or user application processes generate FDCs
referring to "shmget" following forcible termination of the
process or failure of the CPU running it. This is a result of
the Guardian C-files (Cnxxxxxx) for a CPU becoming corrupt
during an update operation, rendering the file and associated
shared memory segment unusable. C-file update operations are
now performed atomically to prevent this problem.

APAR IC60135 - Improve servicability of the "endmqm -i" command to prevent the
command from waiting indefinitely for the queue manager to end.
Following this change after a specified number of seconds, the
command will complete with the message "Queue Manager Running"
and return to the command line with exit status 5.

APAR IC60175 - Description is not available (security/integrity exposure)

APAR IC60361 - Memory leak occurs in SVRCONN channel MCAs which repeatedly open
local queue objects.

APAR IC60455 - WMQ Broker restart may not work correctly.
If the WMQ Broker is restarted using strmqbrk/endmqbrk,
subsequent attempts to restart the broker may fail, and 2033
errors my arise when running the test broker samples and
recycling the broker processes.

APAR IC60119 - System Administration manual incorrectly states the default
value of the TCP/IP Keepalive is "ON"

The following fixes discovered during IBM's development and testing work were
released with V5.3.1.5:

1403 Erroneous SVRCONN channel ended message.
SVRConn channels should not generate "Channel Ended" messages in
the error log, but in some circumstances, threaded svrconn
channels do generate these messages.
1451 Internal changes relating to trace and FDC files sequence numbers
1453 Problem with MQCONN after restart of broker
1516 strmqm fails with invalid ExecutablePath attribute (qmproc.ini)
1560 Port of V51 MQSeries for Compaq NonStop Kernel APAR IC57981.
Backup Queue Server runs out of memory processing non-persistent
messages in 27K range. 
1564 runmqlsr abends in nssclose after a previous 'socket' calls fails
1570 Added Agent type to EC logged threshold and max agent messages.
1576 Change ECA interface to V4
1577 Queue Server message expiration deletion phase log message
1583 Blank channel status entries can get created triggering
channels when AdoptMCA is enabled.
Under certain timing situations, when triggered channels are
used and AdoptMCA is enabled for the queue manager, blank
channel status entries can be created with the JOBNAME
referencing the Channel Initiator (runmqchi), for example:
AMQ8417: Display Channel Status details.
CHANNEL() XMITQ()
CONNAME() CURRENT
CHLTYPE() STATUS(BINDING)
MSGS() BATCHES()
JOBNAME(5,333 $MQCHI OSS(318898190)) RQMNAME()
This problem does not cause any immediate functional problem,
however the blank entries consume channel status table entries
and therefore could prevent legitimate channel starts in the
event that the status table becomes full.
1594 C++ unthreaded libraries use threaded semaphores
1596 Improved cs error reporting
1597 EC started processes sometimes not started in intended CPU
1598 NSS Incorrect component identifiers used in some parts of zig
1608 Queue status errors on failure of a no syncpoint persist message
put or get
1601 Tracing details to the EC to augment the Entry and Exit trace
calls
1611 LQMA Queue manager attribute corruption
1613 Enhanced LEC Failure Handling
1615 The EC may allow the os to choose in which cpu a MCA will start
1616 Channel server comp traps have potential performance impact.
1621 MQCONN does not report valid reason code when agent pool is full
1622 After a channel is started dis chs displays "binding" in some
circumstances when it should display "running"
1623 Incorrect message when MCA allocation fails
1626 Addition of Service information collection tool (SDCP)

New platform support was released in V5.3.1.4:

Fixpack V5.3.1.4 introduced support for the HP Integrity NonStop BladeSystem
platform, NB50000c. Use the H-Series (Integrity) package of WebSphere MQ
for execution on the BladeSystem. Please refer to the Hardware and Software
Requirements section for details about the levels of the J-Series software
required.

The following APAR fixes were released in V5.3.1.4:

APAR IC57020 - runmqtrm does not function correctly and produces errors in some
cases.
When a triggered application is a guardian script file
(ie filecode 101). runmqtrm produces an "illegal program
file format" error. Triggering also does not work correctly
for COBOL or TAL applications.

APAR IC57231 - The execution controller starts repository processes at the
same priority as itself in some cases, and does not take
account of the values set in the qmproc.ini file.

APAR IC57420 - Repository manager restart following failure causes cluster
cache corruption in some circumstances.
If a repository manager abends while a queue manager is under a
heavy load of cluster-intensive operations, in some
circumstances the repository manager that is restarted can
damage the cluster cache in the CPU in which it
is running. This can prevent further cluster operations in that
CPU and cause WMQ processes to loop indefinitely. This release
changes the repository startup to prevent this from happening.

APAR IC57432 - OSS applications that attempt to perform MQI operations from
forked processes encounter errors.
If an oss WMQ application forks a child process, that child
process will encounter errors if it attempts to perform MQI
operations. Some operations may succeed, but will result
in the generation of FDC files.

APAR IC57488 - MQMC channel menu display display error after channel is
deleted.
If a channel is deleted while the channel menu in MQMC
is displayed, refreshing the channel menu produces the
error: "Unknown error received from server. Error number
returned is 1" and will not correctly display the channel
list without restarting MQMC.

APAR IC57501 - unthreaded sender channels to remote destinations with
significant network latency may fail to start with timeout
errors.

APAR IC57524 - Applications launched locally from remote nodes cannot access
some of the queue manager shared memory files due to default
security on those files.

APAR IC57627 - Handling of TMF outages to improve operational predictability.
If TMF disables the ability to begin new transactions
(BEGINTRANS DISABLED), WMQ does not always react in a
predictable or easily diagnosed manner, and applications can
suffer a variety of different symptoms. If TMF is stopped
abruptly (STOP TMF, ABRUPT) queue managers can become unstable
and require significant manual intervention to stop and restart.
Refer to item 18 in "Known Limitations, Problems and
Workarounds" later in this README for more information.

APAR IC57712 - altmqfls --qsize with more than 100 messages on queue fails.
When a altmqfls --qsize is performed with more the 100 MQ
messages in the queue the processing fails.

APAR IC57719 - FDCs from MQOPEN when an error exists in alias queue manager
resolution path. If a queue resolution path includes a queue
manager alias, and the target of the alias does not exist,
this will produce an FDC, rather than just failing the
MQOPEN as would be expected.

APAR IC57744 - CPU goes busy when stopping a threaded SSL receiver channel
using MODE(TERMINATE).
If a stop channel mode(terminate) is used to stop an SSL
receiver channel that is running in a threaded MCA, the CPU
where the MCA is running in begin using large amounts of CPU
time (95% range). This is due to a problem in the threads
library.

APAR IC57876 - Very infrequently, messages put via threaded LQMAs can in some
circumstances contain erroneous CCSID information. This has
been observed to cause conversion errors if the message is
destined for a channel that has the CONVERT(YES) set.
Unthreaded LQMAs do not suffer from this problem.

The following fixes discovered during IBM's development and testing work were
also released with V5.3.1.4:

993 - Due to the way that default file security was used, file security for
certain shared memory files used by the queue manager (SZ***) may

inadvertently change in a way that prevents applications not in
the mqm group from issuing MQCONN. File permissions were rationalised
in this release to reflect those used for other shared memory files.
1458 - Resolve Channel command generates FFSTs.
When resolving In-Doubt channels, FFSTs were generated by the Channel
Server and the MCA. Although the channels were successfully resolved,
the In-Doubt status in a DIS CHS query was not correctly updated.
When resolving In-Doubt channels using the COMMIT option the following
error message was displayed "AMQ8101: WebSphere MQ error (7E0) has
occurred."
1493 - The validation of the qmproc.ini file does not report the error case
where multiple ChannelsNameMatch entries are specified ChlRule1.
1498 - Instmqm does not support installation of the product on
Integrity NonStop BladeSystem platforms.
1507 - Some Execution controller messages were missing "Action" descriptions
when reported in the error log.
1517 - In the qmproc.ini file, the AppRule4-SubvolMatch argument was not
working
1522 - Communications Component Function ids and probes are incorrect. This
resulted in misleading or missing information in trace files generated
for support purposes.
1546 - MQBACK operation incorrectly reports error during broker operations
1549 - Channel Server doesn't shutdown after takeover.
If the Primary Channel Server process is prematurely ended, for
example by a CPU crash, the Backup Channel Server process becomes the
new Primary process. Subsequent attempts to use endmqm will hang
because the new Primary Channel Server process will not end.


The following documentation APARs are addressed by the V5.3.1.4 readme:

APAR IC55404 - REFRESH QMGR PCF command is not documented in the Programmable

command formats manual.

Also - please check the "Limitations" and "Known Problems and Workarounds"
sections later on in this readme for updates.

The following APAR fixes were released in V5.3.1.3:

APAR IC54305 - The HP TNS (non-native) C compiler generates Warning 86 when
compiling MQI applications

while the queue was open, leading to incorrect triggering
behavior
APAR IC56277 - Command Server can loop with INQUIRE QS command with a single
parameter
APAR IC56278 - A remote RUNMQSC DIS QS command always times out
APAR IC56309 - MCAs do not disconnect from some shared memory when ending,

MODE(FORCE) or MODE(TERMINATE) commands
APAR IC56536 - Unthreaded responder channels don't de-register from the EC when
an error occurs during or before channel negotiation. For
example, bad initial data will cause this. Unthreaded MCAs
build up and eventually reach the maximum which prevents further
channel starts
APAR IC56681 - C++ unthreaded Tandem-Float SRLs have undefined references

APAR IC56834 - endmqm -p can sometimes leave MCA processes running

The following fixes discovered during IBM's development and testing work were
released with V5.3.1.3:

and REPMEN are now displayed
1487 - Enhancement to ecasvc utility: changed the display of Agent attributes
to use the "real" qmproc.ini attribute names. Added a new option,
that displays information about all connected applications
1494 - A small memory leak occurs for the delete channel operation
1508 - Multiple qmproc.ini environment variables don't get propagated to
agents or repmen
1509 - The EC failed to stop an MCA that was hung when a preemptive shutdown
was initiated

Backward compatibility
----------------------

IBM WebSphere MQ V5.3.1 for HP NonStop Server is interoperable over channels
with IBM MQSeries(TM) V5.1 for Compaq NSK, as well as any other current or
earlier version of IBM MQSeries or IBM WebSphere MQ on any other platform.

Product compatibility
---------------------

IBM WebSphere MQ V5.3.1 for HP NonStop Server is not compatible
with IBM WebSphere MQ Integrator Broker for HP NonStop Server.
For other compatibility considerations, review the list of suitable
products in the WebSphere MQ for HP NonStop Server Quick Beginnings book.

IBM WebSphere MQ V5.3.1 for HP NonStop Server is compatible with any
currently supported level of IBM WebSphere MQ Client. IBM WebSphere MQ V5.3.1
for HP NonStop Server does not support connections from WebSphere MQ
Extended Transactional Client.

INSTALLATION, MIGRATION, UPGRADE AND CONFIGURATION INFORMATION
==============================================================
Hardware and Software Requirements
----------------------------------

The list of mandatory HP operating system and SPR levels has changed
since the V5.3.1.1 release. Please read the following information carefully,
and if you have any questions, please contact IBM.

For the HP Integrity NonStop Server H-Series systems, the following system
software versions are the minimum mandatory level for V5.3.1.12:

- H06.23.01 or later
- SPR T8306H01^ABJ or later
- SPR T8994H01^AAM or later
- SPR T8397H01^ABD or later
- SPR T1248H06^AAX or later


For the HP Integrity NonStop BladeSystem J-Series systems, the following
system software versions are the minimum mandatory level for V5.3.1.12:

- J06.14.00 or later

Note that V5.3.1.12 is not supported on G-Series systems

Recommended SPRs
-----------------
It has become increasingly complicated to document fixes made by HP
for some of their products, as the products themselves often have multiple
threads (H01, H02, G01, G06 etc..) that can be used on multiple OS levels.

To make it more convenient for our customers to determine whether they already
have a recommended fix installed, or to find the appropriate fix in Scout on
the NonStop eServices Portal, we are now referencing particular problems by
their HP solution number.
If you wish to determine whether your particular level of an SPR contains
the solution, review the document included when you downloaded the product
from Scout or review the softdocs in Scout for the solution number for that
product.

We have added more information about the specific problems reported,
what the symptoms are, workarounds to these problems if relevant,
and the likelihood of it happening.
Please note:
Where versions are inside parentheses beside an HP solution #,
those versions only are affected by that particular solution.

If you use SNA channels with V5.3.1, we recommend the latest levels of the
HP SNAX or ACI Communication Services for Advanced Networking (ICE) be used
for the SNA transport. The following versions were verified by IBM with this
release of WMQ:

ACI Communication Services for Advanced Networking (ICE)
- v4r1 on both HP Integrity NonStop Server and S-Series systems

HP SNAX
- T9096H01 on HP Integrity NonStop Server (H-Series) systems

If you use the WebSphere MQ V5.3 classes for Java and JMS for HP NonStop Server
you will need to install HP NonStop Server for Java Version 1.4.2 or later.
The Java.pdf supplemental document in the <install_path>/opt/mqm/READMES/en_US
directory has been updated in this release. Java/JMS users should review the 
updated document.

Upgrading to V5.3.1.12
---------------------

For systems running H Series operating systems, you may upgrade
any prior service level of WebSphere MQ V5.3.1.x for HP NonStop Server to
V5.3.1.12 level using this release. For NonStop BladeSystem running J series
operating systems, you may upgrade from version V5.3.1.4 only, since V5.3.1.4
is the earliest supported version on J series. If you need to perform a full
installation on a J series system from the original installation media, see the
section later in this readme file for instructions.

The installation tool, svcmqm, is used to upgrade existing installations
to this level. Additionally, the placed files for any prior level of V5.3.1
can be overlaid with the new files from V5.3.1.12 and then instmqm can be used
to create new installations at the updated V5.3.1.12 level.

You must end all queue managers and applications in an installation if you
want to upgrade that installation to V5.3.1.12.

You do not need to re-create any queue managers to upgrade to V5.3.1.12.
Existing queue managers (at any V5.3.1.x service level) will work with
V5.3.1.12 once an installation has been properly upgraded.

If you use SSL channels, and are upgrading from WMQ V5.3.1, you must perform
a small reconfiguration of the Certificate store before running any SSL
channels after you have upgraded. The steps that are required are described
below in the Post-Installation section. If you do not perform this
reconfiguration, SSL channels in the upgraded V5.3.1.12 installation will
fail with the log messages similar to the following:

For sender channels:

09/29/07 08:52:43 Process(0,483 $Z8206) User(MQM.ABAKASH) Program(amqrmppa)
AMQ9621: Error on call to SSL function ignored on channel
'ALICE_BOB_SDRC_0000'.

EXPLANATION:
An error indicating a software problem was returned from a function which is
used to provide SSL support. The error code returned was '0xB084002'. The error
was reported by openssl module: SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations, with reason:
system lib. The channel is 'ALICE_BOB_SDRC_0000'; in some cases its name cannot
be determined and so is shown as '????'. This error occurred during channel
shutdown and may not be sufficiently serious as to interrupt future channel
operation; Check the condition of the channel.
ACTION:
If it is determined that Channel operation has been impacted, collect the items
listed in the 'Problem determination' section of the System Administration
manual and contact your IBM support center.
---- amqccisx.c : 1411 ------------------------------------------------------

AMQ9001: Channel 'ALICE_BOB_SDRC_0000' ended normally.

EXPLANATION:
Channel 'ALICE_BOB_SDRC_0000' ended normally.
ACTION:
None.

For client or receiver channels:

09/29/07 08:05:28 Process(1,802 3 $X0545) User(MQM.HEMA) Program(amqrmppa_r)
AMQ9620: Internal error on call to SSL function on channel '????'.

EXPLANATION:
An error indicating a software problem was returned from an function which is
used to provide SSL support. The error code returned was '0x0'. The error was
reported by openssl module: SSL_load_client_CA_file, with reason: CAlist not
found. The channel is '????'; in some cases its name cannot be determined and
so is shown as '????'. The channel did not start.
ACTION:
Collect the items listed in the 'Problem determination' section of the System
Administration manual and contact your IBM support center.
---- amqccisx.c : 1347 ------------------------------------------------------
09/29/07 08:05:28 Process(1,802 3 $X0545) User(MQM.HEMA) Program(amqrmppa_r)
AMQ9228: The TCP/IP responder program could not be started.

EXPLANATION:
An attempt was made to start an instance of the responder program, but the
program was rejected.
ACTION:
The failure could be because either the subsystem has not been started (in this
case you should start the subsystem), or there are too many programs waiting
(in this case you should try to start the responder program later). The reason
code was 0.

WMQ Application re-compile Considerations :

You do not need to re-compile any applications to upgrade to V5.3.1.12.

WMQ Application linkage Considerations :

a) If upgrading from V5.3.1.5 or later releases (including patch releases) :

Existing applications will continue to work with V5.3.1.12 release. However, 
IBM strongly recommends that if you are upgrading from a release prior to 
5.3.1.7, you review the impact of APARs IC67057 and IC68569 that were fixed in
the V5.3.1.7 release. Please also note internal defect 4158 that is fixed in 
V5.3.1.11. The IC67057, IC68569 and internal defect 4158 fixes will not be 
effective in non-native applications unless the applications are relinked 
using the HP BIND utility. 

b) If upgrading from V5.3.1.4 or earlier releases (including patch releases) :

You MUST use the HP BIND utility to relink any non-native applications prior
to using them with V5.3.1.12. If an application is not re-bound with the 
V5.3.1.12 WMQ product, MQCONN API calls will fail with a MQRC 2059 and the 
WMQ EC process will output an FDC when the MQI incompatibility is detected, 
as follows:

Probe Id :- EC075003
Component :- ecaIsECup
Comment1 :- Application MQ API not compatible, relink application
Comment2 :- <process cpu,pid process name>
Comment3 :- <application executable name>

Installation from Electronic Software Download H or J Series based systems
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

These instructions apply to installing WebSphere MQ for HP NonStop Server,
Version 5.3.1.12, from the package downloaded from IBM. Please note the
additional restrictions for upgrading J Series systems to this version.

Use svcmqm to update an existing installation from the V5.3.1.12 placed files.

1. Unzip the fixpack distribution package - wmq53.1.12.tar.zip.
The fixpack distribution package contains the following files:

readme_wmq_5.3.1.12 - this README
wmq53.1.12_H07.tar.Z - H-Series H06 Package

2. Identify the correct fixpack package to install:

For H-Series (H06) or J-Series systems (J06) use: wmq53.1.12_H06.tar.Z

3. Upload the compressed fixpack archive to the OSS file system in binary mode.
You may wish to store the compressed archive, and the expanded contents
in a location where you archive software distributions from IBM.
If you do this, you should store the compressed archive in a directory
that identifies the version of the software it contains,
for example, "V53112".

mkdir -p /usr/ibm/wmq/V53112
upload (in binary mode) the correct compressed tarfile to this directory

4. Extract the fixpack compressed tarfile using commands similar to:

cd /usr/ibm/wmq/V53112
uncompress wmq53.1.12_H06.tar.Z

tar xvof wmq53.1.12_H06.tar

5. Locate your WMQ V5.3.1.x installation(s). The service installation procedure
requires the full OSS path names of the opt/mqm and var/mqm directories for
each WMQ installation to which the fixpack will be installed.

6. Logon to OSS using the WMQ installation owner's userid

7. End all Queue Managers defined in the WMQ Installation.
endmqm <qmgr name>

Ensure all Queue Managers defined in the WMQ installation
are ended.
dspmq

Ensure that the WMQ installation is at a suitable V5.3.1 level.
mqver -V
See later notes concerning version requirements for NonStop BladeSystem
installation.

8. End any non-Pathway listeners for Queue Managers defined in the
WQM installation:
endmqlsr -m <qmgr name>

9. Verify that no files in the Guardian subvolumes of the installation to
be updated are open. The installation cannot proceed safely unless all
files in these subvolumes are closed. Use the TACL command 'FUP LISTOPENS'
for the files in all three subvolumes - an absence of output indicates
that no files are open. If files are shown to be open, use the output
from the command to identify processes that are holding files open.


10. Backup your WMQ Installation; the fixpack cannot be uninstalled.
instmqm -b can be used to back up an installation. Please refer
to the readme file included with release WMQ V5.3.1.

11. Install the fixpack by running the supplied service tool (svcmqm).
Svcmqm requires the location of the OSS var tree as well
as the OSS opt tree. These locations can be supplied automatically by
running svcmqm in an OSS shell where the environment variables for the
WMQ installation being updated have been established (typically by
sourcing "wmqprofile"). If this is the case, svcmqm does not require the
-i and -v parameters. 

For example:
cd /usr/ibm/wmq/V53112
opt/mqm/bin/svcmqm -s /usr/ibm/wmq/V53112/opt/mqm

If the environment variables for the WMQ installation are not established in 
the environment of svcmqm or if you want to update a WMQ installation other
than the one that your current WMQ environment variable points to, then 
the locations of the OSS opt and var trees must be supplied explicitly using
the svcmqm command line parameters -i and -v.

For example:

cd /usr/ibm/wmq/V53112
opt/mqm/bin/svcmqm -s /usr/ibm/wmq/V53112/opt/mqm
-i /wmq1/opt/mqm
-v /wmq1/var/mqm

svcmqm will prompt to confirm the location of the OSS opt tree for the
installation to be updated.
Type "yes" to proceed.

Svcmqm will then update the installation. The current WMQCSTM file for
the installation will be renamed to BWMQCSTM as a backup copy, before it
is regenerated. Note that any changes to the WMQCSTM file you have made
will not be copied to the new WMQCSTM file, however they will be preserved
in the backup copy made before the WMQCSTM file was regenerated.

12. Repeat Steps 5-11 for any other WMQ installations that you want to update
with this fixpack.

13. You can install this fixpack in the WMQ placed installation files so that
any future WMQ product installations will include the fixpack updates.

To do this, locate your WMQ placed installation filetree containing the
opt directory, make this your current working directory (use 'cd') and
then unpack the contents of the tar archive for this fixpack over the placed
file tree. For example, if the placed files are located in the default
location /usr/ibm/wmq/V531, for a H-Series system:

cd /usr/ibm/wmq/V531
tar xvof /usr/ibm/wmq/V5319/wmq53.1.12_H06.tar

Initial Installation on a NonStop BladeSystem
---------------------------------------------

These instructions apply to installing WebSphere MQ for HP NonStop Server on
a NonStop BladeSystem using the original installation media, in conjunction
with the 5.3.1.12 package downloaded from IBM. NonStop BladeSystem platforms
are not supported prior to V5.3.1.4, and a "from scratch" installation requires
either V5.3.1.4 or later files to be overlaid on a set of placed files
from the base product media prior to performing the installation.
You do NOT need to perform these steps if you have already installed V5.3.1.4
on your NonStop BladeSystem. In this case, follow the standard installation
steps earlier in this readme file.

1. Place the files for the Refresh Pack 1 (5.3.1.0) version of WebSphere MQ

for HP NonStop Server on the target system. Refer to the "File Placement"
section in Chapter 3 of the "WebSphere MQ for NonStop Server Quick
Beginnings" guide. Pages 11-13 describes how to place the files.
Do not attempt to install the placed files using the instmqm script
that was provided with V5.3.1.0 at this time. The V5.3.1.0 version of
instmqm does not support installation on NonStop BladeSystem.

2. Unzip the 5.3.1.12 fixpack distribution package - wmq53.1.12.tar.zip.
The fixpack distribution package contains the following files:

readme_wmq_5.3.1.12 This README
wmq53.1.12_H06.tar.Z H-Series H06 Package

3. This installation requires the wmq53.1.12_H06.tar.Z package.
Locate the WMQ placed installation filetree containing the opt directory
prepared in step 1 above, and upload the wmq53.1.12_H06.tar.Z fixpack
archive to this location in binary mode.

4. Extract the fixpack compressed tarfile using commands similar to:

cd /usr/ibm/wmq/V53112
uncompress wmq53.1.12_H06.tar.Z

5. Unpack the contents of the extracted tar archive for this FixPack over the
placed file tree. For example, if the placed files are located in the default
location /usr/ibm/wmq:

cd /usr/ibm/wmq
tar xvof /usr/ibm/wmq/V53112/wmq53.1.12_H06.tar

6. Use the extracted instmqm script in this FixPack to install the product
using the updated installation file tree and the instructions in Chapter 3
of "WebSphere MQ for NonStop Server Quick Beginnings" guide, pages 13-29.
Before beginning, review the list of changes to Chapter 3 detailed in the
"Documentation Updates" section at the end of this README file. Note also
that the list of installed files displayed will differ from those shown in the
examples in the manual.

Post-Installation
-----------------
If upgrading from WMQ V5.3.1, read the following post-installation instructions:

Non-Native TNS Applications:

Re-BIND any non-native (TNS) applications. See "Upgrading to V5.3.1.12" above 
for more information.

Re-binding non-native (TNS) is REQUIRED if upgrading from V5.3.1.4 or earlier
releases but is RECOMMENDED if upgrading from V5.3.1.5 or later fixpack for 
incorporation of APARs IC67057, IC68569 and internal defect 4158. 

If you use SSL channels and have not already installed V5.3.1.1:

Edit the SSL certificate store, cert.pem and move all the CA certificates
to a new file, trust.pem, stored in the same directory as cert.pem. The
only items that should remain in cert.pem are the queue manager's personal
certificate, and the queue manager's private key. These two items should
be located at the start of the cert.pem file. All other certificates
(intermediate and root CAs) must be moved to trust.pem. The trust.pem file
must be in the same directory as cert.pem, as configured in the queue
manager's SSLKEYR attribute.

Update the copy of the entropy daemon program that you run for SSL channels
on the system with the new version (...opt/mqm/ssl/amqjkdm0).

Enable new support for Danish CCSID 65024:

Customers who wish to enable the new support for Danish CCSID 65024
should do the following to install the revised ccsid.tbl file:

Issue the following commands on OSS:

1. Logon to OSS using the WMQ installation owner's userid
2. End all Queue Managers defined in the WMQ Installation.
endmqm <qmgr name>
3. Source in the installation's wmqprofile
. $MQNSKVARPATH/wmqprofile
4. cp -p $MQNSKOPTPATH/samp/ccsid.tbl $MQNSKVARPATH/conv/table/
5. Start queue managers

Guardian C++ DLLs:

Ensure that the WMQ Guardian C++ DLLs are 'executable' by using "FUP ALTER"
to set their FILECODE to 800 (for H-Series or J-Series). Use commands similar 
to the following:

1. Logon to TACL using the WMQ installation owner's userid

2. OBEY your WMQ Installation's WMQCSTM file
3. VOLUME [#param MQNSKOPTPATH^LIB^G]
4. FUP ALTER IMQI2,CODE 800
5. FUP ALTER IMQI2T,CODE 800
6. FUP ALTER IMQI3,CODE 800
7. FUP ALTER IMQI3T,CODE 800
8. Logoff

Guardian Subvolume File Permissions

The WMQ Guardian Installation Subvolume and all WMQ Guardian Queue
Manager Subvolumes must accessible to both MQM group members
and to users that run WMQ application programs.

Ensure that:

All members of the MQM security group have read, write, execute
and purge permission to these subvolumes.

All users that run WMQ application programs, have read, write
and execute permission to these subvolumes

Restart Queue Managers:

Restart the queue managers for the installation you have
updated with this fixpack.

UNINSTALLATION INFORMATION
==========================

This fixpack cannot be automatically uninstalled if a problem occurs
during the update of an installation using svcmqm.

You should use the instmqm -b option to create a backup of an
installation before applying the service. If a problem occurs
or you need to reverse the upgrade at a later date, use the
instmqm -x option to restore a backup of the installation at the
prior service level.

KNOWN LIMITATIONS, PROBLEMS AND WORKAROUNDS
===========================================

This section details known limitation, problems, and workarounds for
WebSphere MQ for HP NonStop Server, Version 5.3.1.12.

Limitations
-----------

1. The current implementation of Publish / Subscribe is restricted to run
within a single CPU. The control program and all "worker" programs run in
the CPU that was used to run the 'strmqbrk' command.
The Publish/Subscribe broker does not automatically recover in the event
of CPU failures.

2. The current memory management implementation in the Queue Server limits
the total amount of non-persistent message data that can be stored on all
the queues hosted by a single Queue Server to less than 1Gb. The limit of
non-persistent message data on a single queue can not exceed approximately
1Gb therefore, even if a single Queue Server is dedicated to that queue.

3. The number of threads in threaded agent processes (LQMAs or MCAs) or in MQI
applications, is limited to a maximum of 1000 by the limit on open depth of
the HP TMF T-file.

4. API exits are not supported for non-native (TNS) applications. Any other
exit code for non-native applications must be statically bound with the
TNS application.

5. Cluster workload exits are only supported in "trusted" mode. This means
that a separate copy of each exit will run in each CPU and exit code in
one CPU cannot communicate with exit code in another CPU using the normal
methods provided for these exits.

6. Upgmqm will not migrate the following data from a V5.1 queue manager:
messages stored in Message Overflow files (typically persistent messages
over 200,000 bytes in size) will not be migrated. If the option to
migrate message data was selected, the upgrade will fail. if the option
to migrate message data was not selected, the upgrade will not be
affected by the presence of message overflow files.
clustering configuration data - all cluster related attributes of objects
will be reset to default values in the new V5.3 queue manager.
SNA channel configuration - channels will be migrated, but several of the
attributes values will need to be changed manually after the upgrade.
channel exit data - attributes in channels that relate to channel exit
configuration will be reset to default values in the new V5.3 queue
manager.
In all cases where upgmqm cannot migrate data completely, a warning message
is generated on the terminal output as well as in the log file. These can
be reviewed carefully after the upgrade completes for further actions that
may be necessary.

7. Java and JMS limitations

The Java and JMS Classes do not support client connections. WebSphere MQ
for HP NonStop Server does not support XA transaction management, so the
JMS XA classes are not available. For more detail, please refer to the
Java and JMS documentation supplement, Java.pdf.

8. Control commands in Guardian (TACL) environment do not obey the RUN option
"NAME" as expected

A Guardian control command starts an OSS process to run the actual
control command - and waits for it to complete. When the NAME option is
used, the Guardian control command process uses the requested name, but
the OSS process cannot and is instead named by NonStop OS.

If the Guardian control command is prematurely stopped by the operator
(using the TACL STOP command for example) the OSS process running the
actual control command may continue to run. The OSS process may need to be
stopped separately and in addition to the Guardian process.

9. Trace doesn't end automatically after a queue manager restart
(APAR IC53352) and trace changes do not take effect immediately

If trace is active and a queue manager is restarted, the trace settings
should be reset to not trace any more. Instead, the queue manager
continues tracing using the same options as before it was restarted.
The workaround is to disable trace using endmqtrc before ending, or while
the queue manager is ended.

Also, changes to trace settings do not always take effect immediately
after the command is issued. For example, it could be several MQI calls
later that the change takes effect. The maximum delay between making a
trace settings change and the change taking effect would be until the end
of the queue manager connection, or the ending of a channel.

10. Some EMS events generated to default collector despite an alternate
collector being configured (APAR IC53005)

An EMS event message "FFST record created" is generated using the OSS
syslog() facility whenever an FDC is raised by a queue manager. This
EMS event cannot be disabled, and goes to the default collector $0. For
OSS processes, an alternate collector process can be specified by
including an environment variable in the context of these processes
as in the following example:

export EMS_COLLECTOR=\$ALT

Guardian processes always use the default collector because HP do not
provide the ability to modify the collector in the Guardian environment.
HP is investigating if a change is possible. No fix for this problem
has yet been identified.

11. The use of SMF (virtual) disks with WMQ is not supported on Release
Version Updates prior to H06.26 and J06.15 because of restrictions
imposed by the OSS file system. For more details, please refer to the
HP NonStop Storage Management Foundation User's Guide Page 2-12.

12. The maximum channel batch size that can be configured (BATCHSZ attribute)
is 2000. If you need to run channels with batch sizes greater than 680
you must increase the maximum message length attribute of the
SYSTEM.CHANNEL.SYNCQ to 60000.

e.g. from RUNMQSC - ALTER QL (SYSTEM.CHANNEL.SYNCQ) MAXMSGL (60000)

13. The SYSTEM.CHANNEL.SYNCQ is a critical system queue for operation of
the queue manager and should not be altered to disable MQGET or MQPUT
operations, or to reduce the maximum message size or maximum depth
attributes from their defaults.

14. Currently, the cluster transmission queue (SYSTEM.CLUSTER.TRANSMIT.QUEUE)
cannot be moved to an alternative Queue Server because it is constantly
open by several internal components. The following procedure (which
requires a "quiet" queue manager, and a queue manager restart) can be
used to achieve this reconfiguration. Do not use this procedure on a
queue manager that is running in production. Read and understand the
procedure carefully first since it includes actions that cause
internal errors to be generated in the queue manager.

1/ Rename the OSS repository executable (opt/mqm/bin directory)
mv amqrrmfa amqrrmfax 
2/ From OSS enter 'ps -f | grep amqrrmfa | grep X '
where X is the Queue Manager name.
3/ kill -9 those processes returned from step 2
At this point the EC will start continuously generating FDCs and
log messages as it attempts to, and fails, to restart the repository
servers that were stopped. Perform the remaining steps in this
procedure without delay to avoid problems with excessive logging
such as disk full conditions.
4. Verify the processes are stopped
From OSS enter 'ps -f | grep amqrrmfa | grep X '
Where X is the Queue Manager name
5. Issue the altmqfls --server command to move the cluster transmission
queue to an alternate queue server
6. Issue dspmqfls to verify the alternate server assignment
7. Rename the OSS repository executable back to the expected name
mv amqrrmfax amqrrmfa
8. End the queue manager using preemptive shutdown. The EC will generate
FDCs ending because of the earlier attempts to start a repository
manager while the executable was renamed. There will be FDCs and
EC Primary process failover

Component :- xcsExecProgram
Probe Description :- AMQ6025: Program not found
Comment1 :- No such file or directory
Comment2 :- /opt/mqm/bin/amqrrmfa
...
AMQ8846: MQ NonStop Server takeover initiated
AMQ8813: EC has started takeover processing
AMQ8814: EC has completed takeover processing
...
The EC may have to be manually TACL stopped if quiesce or immediate
end is used thus the need for the preemptive shutdown
endmqm -p <qmgr name>
9. Rename the repository manager executable to the original name
mv amqrrmfax amqrrmfa
10. Restart the queue manager
strmqm <qmgr name>

15. In Guardian/TACL environments, support for some WMQ command-line programs
has been deprecated for WMQ Fixpack 5.3.1.3 and later.

The affected command-line programs are:

amqoamd
amqrdbgm
amqrfdm
crtmqcvx
endmqlsr
runmqchi
runmqchl
runmqdlq
runmqlsr
runmqtrm

These programs will continue to function for now, however their use in
Guardian/TACL environments is discouraged. Support for these programs
in Guardian/TACL environments may be withdrawn completely in a future
WMQ 5.3 release/fixpack.

IBM recommends that customers use the OSS version of these programs instead.

Customers who want to route output from WMQ OSS tools to VHS or other Guardian
collectors should use the OSSTTY utility. OSSTTY is a standard utility
provided by OSS and is described in the HP publication "Open System Services
Management and Operations Guide".

Note: See Item 3. in "Known problems and workarounds" for a description of
restrictions when using the MQ Broker administration commands in the
Guardian/TACL environment.

16. Do not use WebSphere MQ with a $CMON process that alters attributes of WMQ
processes (for example the processor, priority, process name or program
file name) when they are started. This is not a supported environment since
there are components in WMQ that rely on these attributes being set as
specified by WMQ for their correct operation.

17. Support for forked processes

MQI Support from forked processes in OSS is subject to the following
restrictions:
1. If forking is used, MQI operations can be performed only from child
processes. Using MQI verbs from a parent process that forks child
processes is not supported and will result in unpredictable
behavior.

2. Use of the MQI from forked processes where the parent or child is
threaded is not supported.

18. TMF Outage handling

TMF outage handling was significantly improved with V5.3.1.4, however there
is still a limitation in V5.3.1.6 and later to be aware of:

1. If a STOP TMF, ABRUPT command is issued, TMF marks all open audited
files as corrupt and the queue manager cannot perform further
processing until this condition is rectified by restarting TMF.
In this state, the queue manager will freeze further operation, and log
the condition in the queue manager log file every 10 seconds for a
maximum of 50 attempts. Whether or not TMF is restored within this
timeframe, the WMQ queue manager should be restarted to reduce the risk
of any undetected damage persisting.

19. Triggering HP NSS non-C Guardian applications

The MQ default Trigger Monitor process, runmqtrm, at present cannot
directly trigger the following application types:

Guardian TACL scripts or macro file
COBOL application
TAL application
An OSS script file (wmqtrig) provides indirect support for these
files types. To use this script, the PROCESS definition APPLTYPE should
be set to UNIX, and the APPLICID should refer to the script as in
the following examples:

For a TACL script called "trigmacf":
APPLICID('/opt/mqm/bin/wmqtrig -c \$data06.fp4psamp.trigmacf')
APPLTYPE(UNIX)

For a COBOL or TAL application called "mqsecha":
APPLICID('/opt/mqm/bin/wmqtrig -p /G/data06/fp4psamp/mqsecha')
APPLTYPE(UNIX)


Notes:
1. TACL scripts use the wmqtrig script with a "-c" option.
The -c option should use the Guardian representation for file name
of the TACL script file, with the special character ($) escaped,
for example:

\$data06.fp4psamp.trigmacf

2. COBOL and TAL applications use the wmqtrig script with a "-p" option.
The -p option must use the OSS representation for the file name of
the application, for example:

/G/data06/fp4psamp/mqsecha

3. C applications can be triggered directly by specifying

APPLICID('$DATA06.FP4PSAMP.MQSECHA')
APPLTYPE(NSK)

To trigger a PIC application using the WMQ Pathway MQS-TRIGMON00
serverclass, a DEFINE is required:

=_RLD_LIB_PATH,CLASS SEARCH,SUBVOL0 <Guardian MQ binary Volume.Subvolume>

For example:
ALTER MQS-TRIGMON00,
DEFINE =_RLD_LIB_PATH,CLASS SEARCH,SUBVOL0 $DATA06.FP4PBIN

4. If the "-p" option is used, gtacl passes the complete MQTMC2 structure
text (which is 560 bytes) to the application being triggered, whereas if
the "-c" option is used, limitations in TACL will cause the triggered 
application to receive 520 bytes only.
Applications intended to be triggered using -p option must handle the 
complete 560 character startup character string.
This can cause problems, particularly with COBOL applications;
Since a COBOL GETSTARTUPTEXT call can process only 529 characters,
triggering a COBOL application with the -p option (560 character startup
string) can result in a memory overwrite and application abend.
In this case, the -c option should be used instead of the -p option."

20. Maximum numnber of LQMA processes

The maximum number of LQMA processes per queue manager is 1417. Attempts to
configure a MaxUnthreadedAgents value of 1418 or greater in the qmproc.ini file
will result in FDCs when the queue manager attempts to start the 1418th LQMA.

21. Limitation on ProcessNameRoot values in qmproc.ini file

The ProcessNameRoot value used in the qmproc.ini file for the MCA, LQMA and 
RepositoryManager stanzas must be unique across all queue managers in all
installations on the system. If the values are not unique, two queue 
managers attempting to create a new process name at the same time may attempt
to use the same sequence of names, resulting in heavy load on the OSS
nameserver and/or FDCs with probes EC062000 from eclStartMCA or EC065000 from
eclStartLQMA. This may result in the queue manager becoming unresponsive.

22. BIND/REPLACE Warning 9

The use of BIND/REPLACE when re-binding non-native (TNS) applications with 
the latest WMQ TNS Library is supported, however, when using this command, 
you may encounter many Bind 'warning 9' messages. These warnings are safe to
ignore, as the changes made in the MQMTNS library are completely contained
within that library and there is no external affect on an application that
would link with that library. Please refer to document 
ID mmr_ns-4.0.6050052.2565545 in KBNS which has been updated by HP to include
this information. 

23. PING CHANNEL uses the =TCPIP^PROCESS^NAME DEFINE as opposed to the 
value set in the qmproc.ini file.

If the TCPIP^PROCESS^NAME DEFINE is invalid, attempts to issue a 
PING CHANNEL request will fail with the following message -
":AMQ9212: A TCP/IP socket could not be allocated."

24. Using multiple cluster receiver channels for a queue manager can cause the 
master and slave repository managers to get out of sync in some configurations, 
this results in FFSTs from rrmHPNSSGetMetaPacket with Comment1 field 
"Meta data mis-match Expected: metalen=xx".
The root cause of this problem has not been identified definitively, but it is
recommended that cluster configurations do not use multiple cluster receiver 
channels for the same cluster on a given queue manager.

25. Format 2 Queue and Queue overflow files are not supported

If an attempt is made to use altmqfls to change extent size or max extents of 
a Queue or Queue overflow file such that the new file size would require a
format 2 file, the attempt will fail and an FDC file containing the following

Probe Id :- XC066050 
Component :- xgcDupPartFile 
... 
Major Errorcode :- xecF_E_UNEXPECTED_RC 
Minor Errorcode :- krcE_UNEXPECTED_ERROR 
Probe Description :- AMQ6118: An internal WMQ error has occurred 
(20800893) 
...
Arith1 :- 545261715 20800893 

26. RUNMQSC DISPLAY QSTATUS(*) TYPE(HANDLE) ALL can return only 500 handles

The current implementation of DISPLAY QSTATUS can handle only 500 queue
handles. In prior releases, executing the command in a scenario where there
were more than 500 handles resulted in an error return and large numbers of 
FFSTs (see internal defect 2230 earlier in this readme). These errors are the
result of a design limitation with the DISPLAY QSTATUS implementation. 
The processing of the command has been modified to handle the scenario cleanly
and return only the first 500 handles retrieved, as supported by the design.

Known problems and workarounds
------------------------------
1. FDCs from Component xcsDisplayMessage reporting xecF_E_UNEXPECTED_SYSTEM_RC

On RVUs H06.06 and later:

These FDCs occur frequently on queue manager shutdown, and at times during
queue manager start, from processes that write to the queue manager log
files at these times, typically the cluster repository cache manager
(amqrrmfa) and the EC (MQECSVR). No functional problem is caused by these
FDCs, except that the queue manager log file misses some log messages
during queue manager shutdown. The FDCs report an unexpected return code
from the HP lseek() function. An example of an FDC demonstrating this
problem follows:

Probe Id :- XC022011
Component :- xcsDisplayMessage
Program Name :- $DATA06.RP1PBIN.MQECSVR
Major Errorcode :- xecF_E_UNEXPECTED_SYSTEM_RC

This problem is fixed by the following HP SPRs

T8620ACM (OSSFS) for H06 HP OS

2. APAR IC54594 - EC abends with non-MQM user running application from non-MQM
directory.

Statically-bound TNS applications that are not relinked after installing 
Fixpack 5.3.1.4 have additional considerations. For these applications, 
qmproc.ini Application Rules 2 and 4 will not work if the application 
is located in a non-MQM directory.

3. The Guardian control commands for the Publish / Subscribe broker
(strmqbrk, endmqbrk, dspmqbrk ... etc) will not work correctly unless they
are run in the same CPU as the broker is running in, or was last running in.

Please use the equivalent OSS commands instead of the Guardian versions, or
ensure that the Guardian Publish / Subscribe broker commands run in the same
CPU as the broker was or is running in.

4. Queue managers occasionally do not delete Temporary Dynamic Queues the 
when the last application closes them. The cause of this is unknown at present.
The problem is rare and unlikely to cause significant impact on queue 
manager operation unless the queues are present in very large numbers.
Queues orphaned in this way cannot be used by applications, and are removed
unconditionally as a part of the normal garbage collection activity during 
a queue manager restart.

DOCUMENTATION UPDATES
=====================

Please note that several supplements to the documentation have been provided
with fixpacks since V5.3 was originally released. These supplements have
been released in Adobe Acrobat format and can found in the
opt/mqm/READMES/en_US directory of any installation as well as the original
software distribution tree (placed files). The following supplements have
been released to date (the name of the file describes the content):

Exits.pdf
Java.pdf
Pubsub.pdf
SNAChannels.pdf
SSLUpdate.pdf
Upgmqmreadme.pdf
Sdcp.pdf

Also please note that the current published versions of the cross-platform
("family") books contain references to the IBM MQSeries V5.1 for Compaq NSK
product which is the previous major version of WebSphere MQ for HP NonStop
Server. Consequently, these references may not be accurate with respect to
the functional support provided by V5.3.1.

Pages 2 & 3: please review the section "Hardware and Software
Requirements" in these release notes for the details of all other updated
requirements
Chapter 3 - Installing WebSphere MQ for HP NonStop Server

Page 12: Product Selection dialog. The names of the products have been
updated to "WebSphere MQ V5.3.1" and "WebSphere MQ V5.3.1 Integrity".
Page 14: instmqm now includes the function of creating an automatic
backup archive of a successful installation, as follows:
Instmqm has been enhanced to provide the ability to back-out an ungrade
installation, and the ability to archive and restore installations
individually. Before instmqm starts to make changes to a system, it will
automatically create an archive of the current installation (OSS opt tree
and Guardian installation subvolumes only) in the root directory
containing the opt tree in OSS. If a failure occurs during installation,
and instmqm has made changes, the user will be asked if they wish to
restore the installation to its original state using the archive created
before changes were made. At the end of a successful installation,
instmqm will now automatically create a backup archive of the new
installation.

Instmqm also supports two new command line options to support creating
and using backup archives independently from an installation:

-b create a backup archive of the installation
-x restore an installation from a backup archive

These options may not be combined with any other options. Both options
require the user to respond to questions at the terminal.

A backup archive file is an OSS pax file, created as follows:

+ the Guardian PAK utility is used to create a backup of the three
Guardian subvolumes for the installation in a file named "WMQSAVED"
+ the PAK backup file is copied to the OSS opt directory of the
installation that is being archived
+ the entire OSS opt tree of the installation (which now includes
WMQSAVED) is then archived by the OSS pax utility

Backup archive files are always created in the directory that holds the
OSS opt tree for the installation. Archive files created automatically
by instmqm are named "mqarchive-yymmdd-hhmmss" where "yymmdd" and
"hhmmss" are numeric strings of the date and time that the backup archive
was created - for example: "mqarchive-061005-143606".

Page 15: instmqm has new command line options as described in these
release notes for creating and restoring backup archives
Page 17: the SnaProviderName and TcpProviderName fields of the
QmgrDefaults stanza in the instmqm response file are used to populate
the proc.ini file to provide installation wide defaults for channels.
Please note that these fields do not get used for the default listener
configuration either on the command line (runmqlsr) or in the queue
manager's Pathway environment. Users must manually configure the
transport names for all listeners.
Page 28: in addition to the manual methods for cleaning up after a failed
installation, instmqm will offer the option to restore the previous
installation from a backup archive in the event of a failure while
upgrading a V5.3 installation to V5.3.1 level. These release notes
describe the additional function.
If an installation was initially created without SSL (selection of the
installation type "CORE" for instmqm), the following procedure can be
used to update the installation to include SSL components. In the
instructions below, <MQInstall> refers to the location of the
installation that needs to be updated and <PlacedInstall> means the
location of the complete set of placed files for the level of WMQ that
corresponds to the installation being updated. All queue managers
must be ended before attempting this procedure.
1. mkdir <MQInstall>/opt/mqm/ssl
2. chmod 775 <MQInstall>/opt/mqm/ssl
3. cp <PlacedInstall>/opt/mqm/ssl/* <MQInstall>/opt/mqm/ssl
4. chmod 775 <MQInstall>/opt/mqm/ssl/amq*"...
5. cp <MQInstall>/opt/mqm/ssl/openssl <MQInstall>/opt/mqm/bin
6. chmod 664 <MQInstall>/opt/mqm/ssl/openssl
7. chmod 774 <MQInstall>/opt/mqm/bin/openssl
8. cp <MQInstall>/opt/mqm/ssl/amqjkdm0 <MQInstall>/opt/mqm/bin
9. chmod 775 <MQInstall>/opt/mqm/bin/amqjkdm0
10. mv <MQInstall>/opt/mqm/lib/amqcctca
<MQInstall>/opt/mqm/lib/amqcctca_nossl
11. mv <MQInstall>/opt/mqm/lib/amqcctca_r
<MQInstall>/opt/mqm/lib/amqcctca_r_nossl
12. cp <MQInstall>/opt/mqm/ssl/amqccssl <MQInstall>/opt/mqm/lib/amqcctca
13. cp <MQInstall>/opt/mqm/ssl/amqccssl_r
<MQInstall>/opt/mqm/lib/amqcctca_r
14. chmod 775 <MQInstall>/opt/mqm/lib/amqcctca*
15. The <MQInstall>/var/mqm/qmgrs/<qmgr name> directory should have an

ssl directory which is where you will store the certificate related
files (cert.pem, trust.pem etc.)
16. The <MQInstall>/opt/mqm/samp/ssl should exist already with the ssl
samples
17. If the entropy daemon is not configured on the system this will need
to be performed. Refer to the WMQ V53 HP NonStop System
Administration Chapter 11 page 165-167
18. Install the certificates per the updated instructions, SSLupdate.pdf
found in <MQInstall>/opt/mqm/READMES/en_US

Chapter 5 - Creating a Version 5.3 queue manager from an existing Version 5.1
queue manager

Pages 37 & 38: this section is completely replaced by the documentation
supplement Upgmqmreadme.pdf supplied with this release.
Chapter 7 - Applying maintenance to WebSphere MQ for HP NonStop Server

Pages 44 & 45: the tool for applying maintenance is named "svcmqm" and
not "installCSDxx".
Page 44: in step 3 of "Transferring and preparing the PTF for
installation", the top level directory of the PTF is opt, and is not
named differently for each PTF. Therefore it is important to manually
create a directory specific to each PTF, download the PTF to that new
directory and then expand the archive within the new directory.
Page 44: in step 2 of "Running the installation script for a PTF", the

svcmqm tool has a different command line from that documented for
"installCSDxx". svcmqm takes three parameters:
svcmqm -i installationtree -v vartree -s servicepackage
where "installationtree" is the full path to the location of the opt/mqm
directory of the installation to be updated
"vartree" is the full path to the location of the var/mqm
directory of the installation to be updated
"servicepackage" is the full path to the location of the opt/mqm
directory of the maintenance to be installed
For example:
svcmqm -i /home/me/wmq/opt/mqm -v /home/me/wmq/var/mqm
-s /home/me/wmqfiles/opt/mqm

which will update the installation in /home/me/wmq/opt/mqm and

/home/me/wmq/var/mqm from the maintenance package in directory tree
/home/me/wmqfiles/opt/mqm.

If either or both the "-i installationtree" and "-v vartree" parameters
are omitted, svcmqm will use the current setting of the appropriate
environment variable - either WMQNSKOPTPATH or WMQNSKVARPATH.

WebSphere MQ for HP NonStop Server System Administration Guide (SC34-6625-00)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 2 - An introduction to WebSphere MQ administration

Page 16: before running any control commands on OSS or NonStop OS it is
necessary to establish the environment variables for the session. When
an installation is created a file called wmqprofile is also created in
the var/mqm directory that will establish the environment for an OSS
shell. Likewise, a file is also created in the NonStop OS subvolume
containing the WMQ NonStop OS samples called WMQCSTM that can be used
to set up the appropriate environment variables for a NonStop OS TACL
session.
To establish the WMQ environment for an OSS shell session:

. wmqprofile

To establish the WMQ environment for a NonStop OS TACL session:

obey WMQCSTM

The same steps are required before running any applications in the
OSS or NonStop OS environment.

Chapter 8 - Managing scalability, performance, availability and data
integrity

Page 104: the last paragraph of the OpenTMF section should be reworded
as follows:
No special administrative actions are required for this use of TMF.
WebSphere MQ uses and manages it automatically. You must ensure that
the RMOPENPERCPU and BRANCHESPERRM configuration parameters of TMF are
set to appropriate values for your configuration. Please see Chapter 12

Transactional Support - Configuring TMF for WebSphere MQ for
information on how to calculate the correct values. The HP TMF Planning
and Configuration Guide describes the subject of resource managers and
heterogeneous transaction processing.

Chapter 9 - Configuring WebSphere MQ

Page 119: the CPUS section should state that the default can be
overridden using the crtmqm -nu parameter. See Chapter 18 - The control
commands for a description of how to use this parameter with crtmqm.
Page 120: the section describing the ARGLIST attribute of a TCP/IP
Listener should also mention the use of the optional -u parameter to
configure channels started by the listener as unthreaded processes.
The default is to run incoming channels as threads in an MCA process.
Page 130: the MQSC command to reload the process management rules is
REFRESH QMGR TYPE(NSPROC) and not RESET QMGR TYPE(NSPROC)
Page 133: Figure 23 remove :
OAM Manager stanza #
OamManager:
Page 136: the Exit properties section should state that the only

supported way of configuring and running a Cluster Workload (CLWL) Exit
for HP NonStop Server is in FAST mode. The CLWLMode setting in qm.ini
is required to be set to FAST, which is the default for WebSphere MQ
on this platform.
Page 139: the MQIBindType attribute of the Channels stanza is set by
crtmqm to FASTPATH. This should not be changed, except under the
direction of IBM Service.
Page 140: the AdoptNewMCA=FASTPATH option is always required for
this platform in order for the adoption of MCAs to be effective. The
"Attention!" box after the description of the FASTPATH option should
be ignored.
Page 140: add the following description of the ClientIdle attribute:
ClientIdle=seconds

ClientIdle specifies the number of seconds of inactivity to permit
between client application MQI calls before WebSphere MQ terminates
the client connection. The default is to not terminate client
connections however long they remain inactive. When a client connection
is terminated because of idle activity, the client application receives
a connection broken result (2009) on its next MQI call.

Chapter 11 - Working with the WebSphere MQ Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) support

A documentation supplement has been written to replace the sections on
Page 170 (Preparing the queue manager's SSL files) to Page 176 (Building
and verifying the sample configuration) because of changes to the files
that WebSphere MQ uses to hold certificates. The documentation supplement
is called SSLupdate.pdf, and can be found in the opt/mqm/READMES/en_US
directory of an installation.

Chapter 12 - Transactional Support

Page 185: The descriptions of the TMF attribute RMOPENPERCPU in the

Resource manager configuration section is modified as follows:
RMOPENPERCPU

Each WebSphere MQ thread or process that handles transactions has
an open of a Volatile Resource Manager in the CPU it runs in. In
addition, each application thread or process using the MQI also has
an open. The minimum requirement for this configuration parameter

is therefore the sum of:
+ all Queue Server processes in that CPU
+ all LQMA and MCA threads running in that CPU
+ all MQI application threads running in that CPU
+ 10 (to account for miscellaneous queue manager processes that
could be running in that CPU)
You should calculate the peak values of these numbers across all CPUs
and add a safety margin to arrive at the correct value for your system.
The HP default value of 128 for this parameter is often suitable for
small configurations, but unsuitable for medium or large ones.


Page 186: add the following paragraph to the Troubleshooting section
for Configuring TMF:
If the RMOPENPERCPU value is not configured to allow sufficient opens
of resource managers in a CPU, WebSphere MQ connections will fail with
an unexpected return code, and FDCs will be generated reporting an
error with the TMF_VOL_RM_OPEN_. The workaround is to distribute
applications and queue manager processes in the CPU that exceeds
the limit to other CPUs. The correct remedy is to schedule an outage
and modify the TMF configuration.

Page 186: add the following paragraph to the Troubleshooting section
for configuring TMF:
If TMF is stopped, or new transactions are disabled, and WMQ requires
an internal "unit of work" (TMF transaction) to perform an update to
a protected resource requested by an MQI call, that call will fail
and the reason code returned will be MQRC_UOW_NOT_AVAILABLE (2255).

Note that in some cases, updates to protected resources may be
required by MQI operations do not directly perform messaging
operations - for example, MQOPEN of a model queue that creates a
permanent dynamic queue. If MQI calls return MQRC_UOW_NOT_AVAILABLE,
check the status of the TMF subsystem to determine the likely cause.

Chapter 14 - Process Management

Page 197: the MQSC command to reload the process management rules is
REFRESH QMGR TYPE(NSPROC) and not RESET QMGR TYPE(NSPROC)

Page 200 and 204: the default value for the maximum number of unthreaded
agents is now 200. The default value for the maximum number of threaded
agents is now 20. the default value for the maximum use count for
threaded agents is now 100.

Page 203: add a new paragraph titled "Pathway":
Pathway
This stanza contains 3 attributes:-
- ProcessName
- DynamicProcessName
- Hometerm
ProcessName is the name of the Queue Managers pathmon process.
If the -np option was specified at queue Manager creation, 
the value of ProcessName will be set to the value of that option 
when the qmproc.ini file is created
If DynamicProcessName is set to Yes, the system will generate a name
for the pathmon process at the time the Queue Manager starts.
If the value is set to no, the value of the ProcessName attribute
will determine the pathmon process name for the queue manager 
Hometerm specifies the value of the hometerm attribute for the Queue 
Manager pathmon process 
If the -nh opton was specified at queue manager creation, the 
value of Hometerm will be set to the value of that option, 
otherwise the default of $ZHOME will be used.

Page 204: the "valid attribute values" for the attribute "ExecutableName"
should be stated as "File name part only of the program to run for the
LQMA or MCA process".

Pages 203 - 205, Table 20: Process Management: Keyword definition Summary
There are a number of errors in the Process Management Keyword
definition table:

1. Environment variables:
ENVxx should be Envxx

2. Executable Name to Match:
ExecNameMatch should be ExeNameMatch

3. Fail if CPU unavailable:
FailOnCPUunavail should be FailOnCPUUnavail

4. Preferred number of Threaded Agents:
PreferedThreadedAgents should be PreferredThreadedAgents

Default values:

5. MaxThreadedAgents: change from 10 to 20

6. MaxUnthreadedAgents: change from 20 to 200

7. MaxThreadedAgentUse: change from 10 to 100

To configure RDF to work with a existing WMQ V53 queue manager:
End the WMQ V53 queue manager.
Using the HP BACKUP or PAK utility specifying the AUDITED option
Backup the primary site Guardian WMQ queue manager subvolume.
Using the HP RESTORE or UNPAK utility specifying the AUDITED option
Restore the files on the backup site.
Ensure that on the backup system that the alternate key file
attribute (ALTKEY) for files amqcat and amqpdb of each queue
manager are set to the correct (backup system) node name
Page 217: the example of the altmqfls command to set the RDF
compatibility mode for large persistent messages is correct but too
simplistic. Please use care when using altmqfls to set the queue options

(--qsoptions parameter) and refer to the reference section for the
control commands for a complete description of using this option.
Page 217: the bullet point that describes the configuration of AutoSYNC
filesets is incorrect when it states that NO ALLSYMLINKS should be
specified. Replace sub-bullet item number 2 with the following text:
2. The entire queue manager OSS directory structure
var_installation_path/var/mqm/qmgrs/qmname.

You must specify the absolute path name of the queue manager's
directory. Specify the ALLSYMLINKS option for this fileset to
ensure that AutoSYNC correctly synchronizes the symbolic link
(G directory) in the queue manager's directory to the NonStop OS queue
manager's subvolume on the backup system.

Chapter 16 - Troubleshooting

Page 230: after the section "Is your application or system running
slowly?", insert the following new section:
Are your applications or WebSphere MQ processes unable to connect?

If connection failures are occurring:

is the User ID under which the application runs authorized to
use this queue manager?
are SAFEGUARD permissions preventing read access to the WebSphere
MQ installation files by the User ID running the application?
are the environment variables established for the application
process, so that the correct installation of WebSphere MQ is being
used?
if necessary, has the application been relinked or rebound with
any static MQI libraries that it uses?
is a resource problem preventing the queue manager from allowing
the connection? Review the troubleshooting section under TMF
Configuration on Page 185 and 186 for information about the
RMOPENSPERCPU TMF attribute.

Chapter 18 - The control commands

Page 93: The example of the --resetmeasure option is missing a mandatory
parameter having the value "YES" or "NO". The paragraph on page 93 describing
the --resetmeasure option should be replaced with the following

"The queue server can maintain the Measure counter only if it is included 
in an active measurement. If it is not included in an active measurement, 
and messages are put in the queue and removed from the queue, the value 
of the counter will no longer represent the current depth of the queue. 
If the counter is subsequently included in an active measurement, you can 
cause the queue server to reset the Measure counter to the current depth 
of the queue by using the --resetmeasure parameter on the altmqfls command, 
as follows: altmqfls --qmgr QMGR --type QLOCAL --resetmeasure TEST.QUEUE YES"

Page 244: The mandatory YES|NO parameter is missing from the syntax diagram

Page 247: The mandatory YES|NO parameter is missing from the description
of the option

Page 243: the control commands for the Publish / Subscribe broker are
not referenced here. Refer to the WebSphere MQ V6.0 Publish/Subscribe
User Guide and the documentation supplement for Publish/Subscribe on
HP NonStop Server - Pubsub.pdf.
Page 255: if the OSS environment variable or Guardian PARAM MQPATHSEC
is defined and set to one of the standard NonStop OS security attributes
(A, N, C, G, O, or U) when crtmqm is run, the default PATHWAY SECURITY
attribute value of "G" will be overridden by the value of the environment
variable / PARAM. This can be used to restrict access to the queue
manager's Pathway environment. The current Pathway attributes can be
displayed in PATHCOM using the INFO PATHWAY command.
Page 255: the -nu parameter for setting the default CPUS attribute
in Pathway serverclasses does not accept all the values that Pathway
allows for this attribute. The only accepted values (and the result in
Pathway configuration) are of the form:
-nu value Pathway CPUS attribute
-------- ---------------------
-nu a CPUS (a:0)
-nu a:b CPUS (a:b)

More complex Pathway serverclass CPUS attributes settings must be
configured after the queue manager has been created, using the HP
PATHCOM utility.

Chapter 23 - API exits

Pages 373-375: please review the updates to this section in the
documentation supplement for API exits for HP NonStop Server called
Exits.pdf. This supplement has been extensively revised for V5.3.1.1
to clarify the requirements and process for creating and integrating
exits with WebSphere MQ.

Appendix B - Directory structure

Pages 430 and 431: there is a new G symbolic link to the Guardian
subvolume containing the product executables in
.../var/mqm/qmgrs/@SYSTEM
Page 431: the content of the ssl directory is revised with V5.3.1.1
as follows:
This directory contains up to four files used by the SSL support:

The queue manager certificate and private key store (cert.pem)
The trusted certificates store (trust.pem)
The pass phrase stash file for the queue managers certificate
and private key store (Stash.sth)
The certificate revocation list file (optional - crl.pem)

Appendix F - Environment variables

Page 446: there are several environment variables that are used by the
Guardian sample build scripts to locate the header files and the
libraries. Suitable settings for these are established in the
WMQCSTM file (in the Guardian samples subvolume). The environment
variables, and their meanings, are:
MQNSKOPTPATH^INC^G include file/header subvolume
MQNSKOPTPATH^BIN^G binaries subvolume
MQNSKOPTPATH^LIB^G binaries subvolume
MQNSKOPTPATH^SAMP^G samples subvolume

In addition, an HP environment variable is also required (and set in
WMQCSTM) that locates the OSS DLLs for dynamic loading from Guardian.
The environment variable is ^RLD^FIRST^LIB^PATH.

Page 468: add after the "Queue Server Tuning parameters" section

Queue Manager Server tuning parameters

MQQMSHKEEP If this ENV is set for the MQS-QMGRSVR00 serverclass, its value
specifies a numeric value in seconds to override the default housekeeping
interval of the queue manager server. The default interval is 60 seconds.
The housekeeping interval controls how frequently the queue manager
server generates expiration reports. The permitted range of values is 1-300.
Values outside this range will be ignored and the default value will be used.

MQQMSMAXMSGSEXPIRE If this ENV is set for the MQS-QMGRSVR00 serverclass,
its value specifies a numeric value to override the default maximum number
of expiration report messages that are generated during housekeeping
operations by a queue manager server. The default maximum number of expiration
messages generated is 100. The permitted range of values is 1-99999. Values
outside this range will be ignored and the default value will be used.


Appendix H - Building and running applications

Building C++ applications,

Table 47 - there is no multi-threaded library support in
Guardian so there should not be an entry for a
multi-threaded guardian library

Table 48 - the name of this table should be "Native non-PIC"

References to G/lib symbolic links have changed with WMQ 5.3.1 to lib/G

Note that the MQNSKVARPATH and MQNSKOPTPATH environment variables must
be established in the environment, before an application starts up.
They cannot be programmatically set once a program is running by using
putenv().

Page 461: Building COBOL applications

Add the following text:

"In both the OSS and Guardian environment, the CONSULT compiler
directive referencing the MQMCB import library must now be used along
with correct linker options. Refer to the BCOBSAMP TACL script described
in Appendix I for more information."

Appendix I - WebSphere MQ for NonStop Server Sample Programs

Pages 465-466: The section "TACL Macro file for building C Sample Programs"
is replaced by the following:

BCSAMP - Build a C-Language Sample.

This TACL script will compile and link a C-language sample into an
executable program. The script expects that the WMQ environment has
been established using WMQCSTM.

BCSAMP usage:

BCSAMP <type> <source>

<type> The type of executable program that should be built.

Valid values are:

pic A native PIC program
tns A non-native TNS program

<source> The filename of the source module to be compiled and linked

The <source> filename should end with a 'C'. The final program name is
the same as the source filename with the trailing 'C' removed.

Page 467: The section "TACL Macro files for building COBOL Sample
Programs" is replaced by the following:

BCOBSAMP - Build a COBOL Sample.

This TACL script will compile and link a COBOL sample into an executable
program. The script expects that the WMQ environment has been established
using WMQCSTM.

BCOBSAMP usage:

BCOBSAMP <type> <source>

<type> The type of executable program that should be built.

Valid values are:

pic A native PIC program
tns A non-native TNS program

<source> The filename of the source module to be compiled and linked

The <source> filename should end with an 'L'. The final program name is
the same as the <source> filename with the trailing 'L' removed.

Page 469: The section "TACL Macro files for building TAL sample programs"
is replaced by the following:

BTALSAMP - Build a TAL Sample.

This TACL script will compile and link a TAL sample into an executable
program. The script expects that the WMQ environment has been established

using WMQCSTM.

BTALSAMP usage:

BTALSAMP <source>

<source> The filename of the source module to be compiled and linked

The final program name is the same as the <source> filename with the
trailing character removed.

Appendix J - User exits

refer to the documentation supplement Exits.pdf for updated information
about configuring and building user exits. This supplement has been
extensively revised for V5.3.1.1 to clarify the requirements and process
for creating and integrating exits with WebSphere MQ.
The description of compile options for PIC unthreaded, threaded and
Guardian dlls in this document is incorrect. The option specified as
"-export all" should be "-export_all".

Appendix K - Setting up communications

Page 482: The TCP/IP keep alive function

By default, the TCP/IP keep alive function is not enabled. To enable
this feature, set the KeepAlive=Yes attribute in the TCP Stanza in the
qm.ini file for the queue manager.
If this attribute it set to "yes" the TCP/IP subsystem checks periodically
whether the remote end of a TCP/IP connection is still available. If it is
not available, the channel using the connection ends.
If TCP stanza KeepAlive attribute is not present or is set to "No", the
TCP/IP subsystem will not check for disconnection of the remote end.

Chapter 9 "Configuring WebSphere MQ" page 140 describes the TCP stanza
attributes.

APAR IC58859: wmqtrig script
The wmqtrig script processing the -c option, for triggering a TACL macro/script
file, will not normally propagate the TMC data to the macro/script file.
Some applications may need the TMC for processing. A switch used in conjunction
with the -c option, -5.1, has been added which will pass the TMC data to a TACL
macro/script file with the wmqtrig script. Define the APPLICID attribute with
the -5.1 switch, for example:
APPLICID(/wmq/opt/mqm/bin/wmqtrig -5.1 -c \$data06.test.trigmac)

SSLupdate.pdf page 7
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The SSLupdate.pdf document was first released with Fixpack 5.3.1.1

The SSL test scripts expect that a default TCP/IP process ($ZTC0) is
configured on the system to be used during the test. The configuration
will need modification if a non-default TCP/IP process does not exist
on the system or another TCP/IP process is used to communicate with the
partner system. The ALICE.sh and/or BOB.sh scripts that setup of the
listener (runmqlsr) will need modification to add the -g option to use a
non-default TCP/IP process.

2. "Describe your problem and gather background information"
3. "Submit your problem"

Determine the business impact of your problem


When you report a problem to IBM, you are asked to supply a severity
level. Therefore, you need to understand and assess the business impact
of the problem that you are reporting. Use the following criteria:

---------------------------------------------------------------+

Severity 1 The problem has a critical
business impact: You are unable
to use the program, resulting in
a critical impact on operations.
This condition requires an
immediate solution.

---------------------------------------------------------------+

Severity 2 This problem has a significant
business impact: The program is
usable, but it is severely
limited.

---------------------------------------------------------------+

Severity 3 The problem has some business
impact: The program is usable,
but less significant features
(not critical to operations) are
unavailable.

---------------------------------------------------------------+

Severity 4 The problem has minimal business
impact: The problem causes
little impact on operations, or
a reasonable circumvention to
the problem was implemented.

---------------------------------------------------------------+

Describe your problem and gather background information

When describing a problem to IBM, be as specific as possible. Include
all relevant background information so that IBM Software Support
specialists can help you solve the problem efficiently. See the
MustGather Web page
http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21229861 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21229861] for
details of the documentation required. To save time, know the answers to
these questions:

What software versions were you running when the problem occurred?
Do you have logs, traces, and messages that are related to the problem
symptoms? IBM Software Support is likely to ask for this information.
Can you re-create the problem? If so, what steps do you perform to
re-create the problem? Did you make any changes to the system? For example,
did you make changes to the hardware, operating system, networking software,
or other system components? Are you currently using a workaround for the
problem? If so, please be prepared to describe the workaround when you
report the problem.

Submit your problem

You can submit your problem to IBM Software Support in one of two ways:

Online: Go to the Submit and track problems tab on the IBM Software Support
site at http://www.ibm.com/software/support/probsub.html [http://www.ibm.com/software/support/probsub.html]. Type your
information into the appropriate problem submission tool.
By phone: For the phone number to call in your country, go to the "Contacts"
page of the IBM Software Support Handbook at
www.ibm.com/support/handbook [www.ibm.com/support/handbook], click 'contacts' and then click the name 
of your geographic region.

If the problem you submit is for a software defect or for missing or
inaccurate documentation, IBM Software Support creates an Authorized
Program Analysis Report (APAR). The APAR describes the problem in
detail. Whenever possible, IBM Software Support provides a workaround
that you can implement until the APAR is resolved and a fix is
delivered. IBM publishes resolved APARs on the Software Support Web site
daily, so that other users who experience the same problem can benefit
from the same resolution.

 IBM Purging the connection pool of a WebSphere Application Server data source using the data source MBean - United States was app server TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 During the testing or troubleshooting of an enterprise application, it may become necessary to purge the connection pool of a WebSphere Application Server data source of existing connections. 

SYMPTOM
Changes to the application or environment may invalidate cached connections in the Connection Manager pool. Although these connections will eventually be discarded through the normal processing of the connection requests, it may be desirable to purge them all at once and allow the pool to refill with new, valid connections.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
WebSphere Application Server has an operation on the data source MBean that can be used to purge the connection pool. WebSphere Application Server MBean may be called via the wsadmin console, see the IBM Information Center topic "Scripting the application serving environment (wsadmin)" for more details. The operation name is: purgePoolContents. 

The purgePoolContents operation has two options: 

 1. Normal:  * This is the default option. 
     * Existing in-flight transactions will be allowed to continue work. 
     * Shared connection requests will be honored. 
     * Free connections are cleaned up and destroyed. 
     * In use connections (for example: connections in transactions) are cleaned up and destroyed when returned to the connection pool. 
     * A close() call issued on any connection obtained prior to the purgePoolContents will be done synchronously (for example: wait for the jdbc driver to return before proceeding). 
     * Requests for new connections (not handles to existing old connections) will be honored.
       
       
    
    
 2. Immediate:  * No new transactions will be allowed to start on any connections obtained prior to the purgePoolContents call. Instead, a StaleConnectionException is thrown. 
     * No new handles will be handed out on any connections obtained prior to the purgePoolContents call. Instead, a StaleConnectionException is thrown. 
     * Existing in-flight transactions will be allowed to continue work. Any new activities on a purged Connection will cause a StaleConnectionException or an XAER_FAIL exception (in the case of XA) 
     * A close() call issued on any connection obtained prior to the purgePoolContents call will be done asynchronously (for example: no waiting for the jdbc driver to return) This is useful if the driver returns. 
     * Due to the fact that close() does not wait, the number of connections will be decremented immediately in WebSphere Application Server. This might cause the total number of connections in WebSphere Application Server to be temporarily out of sync with the database total number of connections. 
     * Requests for new connections (for example: not handles to existing old connections) will be honored.
    
    


Examples of operations that can be executed on the data source MBean using the wasdmin console:  1. List all data sources:
    Using Jacl:
    $AdminControl queryNames *:type=DataSource,*
    
    Using Jython:
    AdminControl.queryNames("*:type=DataSource,*")
    
    
 2. Initialize a variable to specify a data source (this example uses Default Datasource, but any data source name listed in the output of above command can be used):
    Using Jacl:
    set name "Default Datasource"
    set ds [$AdminControl queryNames *:type=DataSource,name=$name,*] 
    
    Using Jython:
    name = "Default Datasource"
    ds = AdminControl.queryNames("*:type=DataSource,name="+name+",*") 
    
    
 3. View the pool contents by invoking the showPoolContents operation of the data source MBean:
    Using Jacl:
    $AdminControl invoke $ds showPoolContents
    
    Using Jython:
    print AdminControl.invoke(ds, "showPoolContents")
    
    
 4. View contents of all pools by invoking the showAllPoolContents operation of the data source MBean:
    Using Jacl:
    $AdminControl invoke $ds showAllPoolContents
    
    
    Using Jython:
    print AdminControl.invoke(ds, "showAllPoolContents")
    
    
 5. Immediately purge the pool by invoking the purgePoolContents operation of the data source MBean with the immediate option:
    Using Jacl:
    $AdminControl invoke $ds purgePoolContents immediate
    
    
    Using Jython:
    AdminControl.invoke(ds, "purgePoolContents", "immediate")
    
    

If the purge operation is successful, no response will be observed. If the purge operation is not successful, the response will indicate a possible reason for failure. One common reason for failure is attempting to purge the contents of a connection pool which is not yet available (the connection pool is not created until a naming look-up of the associated datasource or connection factory occurs), resulting in an illegal state exception.

 IBM DB2 LUW precompile, prep may write different code to DB2 z/OS - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why does DB2 LUW precompile, prep write different code to DB2 z/OS? 

CAUSE
It is an expected current DB2 LUW behavior.

ANSWER
Here is an example. 

------------------------------ 
<Before PRECOMPILE> 
01 BLOB1 USAGE ID SQL TYPE IS BLOB(10485760). 

<PRECOMPILE on z/OS> 
01 BLOB1. 
02 BLOB1-LENGTH PIC S9(9) COMP. 
02 BLOB1-DATA. 
49 FILLER PIC(10485760). 

<PRECOMPILE on LUW> 
01 BLOB1. 
02 BLOB1-LENGTH PIC S9(9) COMP. 
02 BLOB1-DATA PIC(10485760). 
------------------------------ 

As above, we see DB2 z/OS has below two lines:
------------------------------ 
02 BLOB1-DATA. 
49 FILLER PIC(10485760). 
------------------------------ 
but DB2 LUW writes only one line as below for above two lines part.
------------------------------ 
02 BLOB1-DATA PIC(10485760). 
------------------------------ 

It is an expected current DB2 LUW behavior and we don't have any hidden 
option to generate the cobol declarations similar to z/OS precompiler.

Note:
This behavior might be changed without notice in the future. We can confirm whether this technote
is valid or not by following above scenario.
Please contact your Sales Rep to submit a potential design change towards a future release.
Or please open a ticket, Request For Enhancement at https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rfe/ [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rfe/]

     * LOG_FILE
       This variable represents the location and name of the silent log file to write.
       
       
       By including the -acceptLicense parameter, you agree to the terms and licenses of this product.
       
       
    
    
 2. After updating the command for your environment, run the command from the tools directory under the Installation Manager install location. 
    
    The following command is an example in which only the IBM Business Process Manager refresh pack needs to be applied:
    C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\Installation Manager\eclipse\tools\imcl install com.ibm.bpm.PS.v85 -acceptLicense -installationDirectory C:\IBM\BPM\v8.5 -repositories C:\BPM855_repository -log silent_update.txt 
 3. When the silent refresh pack installation completes, check the log files to ensure that the installation completes successfully. A success message that is similar to the following text displays on the command line:
    
    Updated to com.ibm.bpm.ADV.v85_8.5.5000.20140604_1130 in the C:\IBM\BPM\v8.5 directory

Upgrading the Process Designer 

After you update your Process Center with a fix pack, refresh pack, or interim fix, you must update the Process Designer to the same level. To make the updates, download the Process Designer file again and run the installation. Only the fixes or changes are applied.


About this task
When you install the fix pack, refresh pack, or interim fix, the IBM Process Designer.zip file is updated also. You must download it and install the updated Process Designer to the directory where you already installed Process Designer.


Procedure 

 1. Open the Process Center.
    
    
 2. Click the IBM Process Designer Download option. 
    
    
 3. When you are prompted, save the IBM Process Designer.zip file to your file system. This file contains everything that you need to install and run IBM Process Designer. Depending on your network connection, the download might take several minutes to complete.
    
    
 4. Extract the contents of the IBM Process Designer.zip file to a temporary directory on your file system.
    
    
 5. Open a command window and change to the directory where you extracted the contents of the IBM Process Designer.zip file. 
    
    
    Important: If you are running Microsoft Windows 7, Windows Vista, or Windows Server 2008, right-click the command prompt and select Run as administrator.
    
    
 6. Run one of the following commands to update the Process Designer. Use the same command that you used to install the Process Designer.  * Default location (C:\IBM\ProcessDesigner\v8.5)  * installProcessDesigner_admin.bat 
        * installProcessDesigner_nonadmin.bat
          
          
       
       
     * Different location  * installProcessDesigner_admin.bat install_location 
        * installProcessDesigner_nonadmin.bat install_location
          
          
       
       If the location has spaces in the directory name, put the whole location in quotation marks. The following examples show how to install to a different location.  * installProcessDesigner_admin.bat D:\IBM\PD 
        * installProcessDesigner_admin.bat "D:\Process Designer\"
       
       
    
    


Results 
IBM Process Designer is updated. Only the fixes or changes are applied. Installation messages are recorded in the %TEMP%\IBMProcessDesignerInstall.log file, where the %TEMP% variable is typically set to C:\Documents and Settings\current_user_name\Local Settings\Temp.

Refresh pack install verification 

For upgrades of installations with existing profiles, refer to the Identifying profile update errors [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27042066#identify] section under the Profile upgrade tab for details on verifying the refresh pack installation. 

Note: Installation Manager on the Microsoft Windows operating system does not recognize profile update errors. When you upgrade an installation on Windows, you must look at the Identifying profile update errors [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27042066#identify] section, even if Installation Manager ends with the following message: The packages are updated.

Command line interface of IBM Installation Manager for a silent roll back of a refresh pack

Note: The following procedure rolls back only the product binary. Any existing profiles that were upgraded during a refresh pack installation are not rolled back; you must restore the profiles from the backup you took before you upgraded the product. Any new profiles created after the upgrade cannot be reused; you must delete and recreate the profiles after you have completed the rollback process.


Graphical user interface (GUI) of IBM Installation Manager to roll back an installation


 1.  Close all programs that were installed using Installation Manager before rolling back.
     
     
 2.  Start Installation Manager. See Installation directories for the product and profile [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS_8.5.5/com.ibm.wbpm.imuc.doc/topics/rins_installation_paths.html] for more information on where Installation Manager is installed.
     
     
 3.  From the Start page of the Installation Manager, click Roll back to start the Roll back packages wizard.
     
     
 4.  On the Roll Back Packages page, from the Package Group Name list, select the package group that contains the packages that you want to roll back and click Next.
     
     
 5.  Select the version of the package to which you want to roll back and click Next. 
     
     
 6.  Read the summary information and click Roll Back to roll back the package. 
     
     
     When the rollback process completes, a message that confirms the success of the process is displayed near the top of the page. 
     
     
 7.  Optional: Click View log file to open the log file for the current session in a new window. 
     
     
 8.  Click Finish to close the wizard.

 IBM Clarification of WebSphere Message Broker support of Resource Registry with WebSphere Transformation Extender for Message Broker - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Does IBM® WebSphere® Message Broker support a Resource Registry file from IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender for Message Broker? 

ANSWER
WebSphere Transformation Extender maps that are called from WebSphere Message Broker can use the WebSphere Transformation Extender Resource Registry. WebSphere Message Broker itself does not provide any facility for working with resource registries in areas of the message flow outside of the WebSphere Transformation Extender plugin. 

In the WebSphere Transformation Extender for Message Broker documentation, the following sentence in the topic "Setting resource registry on execution groups:" 


Configure WebSphere Message Broker to use the WebSphere Transformation Extender Resource Registry by setting the resource configuration (.mrc) file on execution groups. 




Should read: 


Configure WebSphere Transformation Extender for Message Broker to use the WebSphere Transformation Extender Resource Registry by setting the resource configuration (.mrc) file on the WebSphere Message Broker execution groups.

 IBM How to enable Baselining in your monitored application. - United States tema enable baselining Unknown application health status CAMADALL CAMADINST TECHNOTE (FAQ)

THIS DOCUMENT APPLIES ONLY TO THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGE VERSION(S):
 US English 

QUESTION
 Steps to enable Baselining in your monitored application. 

ANSWER
The health of the monitored application is calculated against an internally stored baseline threshold. The baselining of the application is a process that uses a pre-defined mathematical and statistical method to automatically calculate a threshold based on response time information typically collected over a period of time (few days to few weeks.) 

By default baselining gets enabled with a situation WasAppDiscoverd. This situation is enabled by default and will discover new applications then run a take action to start the baselining. So if this situation is not enabled then you should enable it and assign to the ITCAM App Server managing system list. 

You want to do baselining with normal or typical load on the server over a period of few days to few weeks, or even few months. The performance of the application under this load is considered good (you will see "Good"" in the Application Health views) and deviation from this performance indicates degrading health ("Bad" or "Fair" in the Application Health views) of the monitored application. 

To start baselining for your application server, please follow these steps: 

(Note 1: in this example, I've used a WebSphere-based application but you can also do the same for any application on your J2EE agent also.) 

(Note 2: Before beginning baselining, make sure you have typical or normal load on the server to set the baselining threshold values.) 

1. Login to your TEPS, select Application Health, right-click on it, go to Workspace and select Application Registry. Look at the panels on the right and observe the baselining columns. If they're blank, your baselining has not been started. 

2. Next select Application Health, right-click on it, go to Workspace and select Application Health status. If you see Unknown, then you know the baselining has not started or not been calculated. 

3. High-lite your application, select the small yellow chain link in the first unnamed column and select Application Configuration Details. See screenshot here: 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21653905&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21653905&aid=1] 

4. In the bottom panel on the right select the line that says All and high-lite it. Then right-click it, select Take Action and Select. In the pull-down, select Start_Baselining and enter the Period (2 days), Update_Interval (every 2 hours), and Run_Clean set to 1 (clean start.) If you wish, you can change these values to whatever you want. 

See screenshots here:

Hit OK twice and you should get a Command completed successfully message. (Note: If you get a Baselining_Already_Active message in the pop-up window, then you should do another Take Action and Stop_Baselining first if you want to do the baselining again.)

Once you have the baselining active, let it run for the period of time with typical load on the server. After the baselining is complete, the Unknown values in the Application Health should now change to Good or Fair or Bad depending on threshold values.

 IBM WebSphere DataPower M/T 9235 appliance might incorrectly report failure of both power supplies - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 The IBM WebSphere DataPower M/T 9235 appliance might incorrectly report the failure of both power supplies. This message is not reported on all appliances and can occur rarely in the field. 

ANSWER
The following message would be present in the DataPower logs: 

System power supply #2 has failed.

or logging event code: 

0x80400022 System power supply #2 


The problem can be confirmed by issuing the following commands on the appliance CLI:

co 
test hardware 
exit 

The following output from the test hardware command confirms this problem: 

[failure] Power supply '1' has no AC input power, or is not present.
[failure] Power supply '2' has no AC input power, or is not present.

Other results in the test hardware command might also show incorrect values.

This problem does not affect the operation of the appliance other than the continuous reporting power supply failure message. 

To confirm the power supplies are working normally you may check the LED status on the power supplies. If the LED's are green the power supplies are working normally.


To recover from the false errors perform a reboot of the appliance: 

From the WebGUI: 

Control Panel → System Control → In the “Shutdown” section choose “Reboot System” then click “Shutdown” 

 

From the CLI: 

top 

shutdown reboot 

y 


This problem is caused by a highly intermittent error that may allow the sensor reading mechanism to get into a bad state. This bad state then generates the false error messages. In most cases, a reboot of the appliance will reset the sensors and no additional errors are logged. The highly intermittent error rarely occurs again on the same appliance 

If the issue reoccurs on the same appliance contact IBM DataPower support [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21236322] with the following information: 

1) How many times have you seen the issue on the same appliance? 

2) Gather the outputs for the following CLI commands:
show clock
show version
show ipmi
show sensors-other

 IBM Runstats may update unexpected HIGH2KEY and LOW2KEY statistic values which may cause SQL1227N - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why is SQL1227N returned when replay db2look output? 

CAUSE
It is an known limitation of current DB2 V9.7 and above versions' runstats.

ANSWER
If we run an example scenario below, at the end of script "db2 -tvf db2_SAMPLE.sql" 

gets SQL1227N.
--- repro.sh ---
#!/bin/sh

db2 -v "drop db sample"
db2 -v "create db sample"
db2 -v "connect to sample"
db2 -v "drop table db2inst1.tab1"
db2 -v "create table db2inst1.tab1 ( col1 varchar(10) )"
db2 -v "insert into db2inst1.tab1 values (NULL),(' '),(' '),(' ')"
db2 -v "runstats on table db2inst1.tab1"
db2 -v "terminate"
db2 -v "connect to sample"
db2look -d sample -a -e -m -o db_SAMPLE.sql

db2 -v terminate
db2 -v "drop db sample"
db2 -v "create db sample"
db2 -v "connect to sample"
db2 -tvf db_SAMPLE.sql | tee test.log
# replay db2look output and gets SQL1227N at this point
db2 -v terminate
----------

Here is the SQL1227N message:
-----
UPDATE SYSSTAT.COLUMNS SET COLCARD=4, NUMNULLS=1, SUB_COUNT=-1, SUB_DELIM_LENGTH=-1, 
AVGCOLLENCHAR=7, HIGH2KEY='', LOW2KEY=' ', AVGCOLLEN=12 WHERE COLNAME = 'COL1' 
AND TABNAME = 'TAB1' AND TABSCHEMA = 'DB2INST1'
DB21034E The command was processed as an SQL statement because it was not a
valid Command Line Processor command. During SQL processing it returned:
SQL1227N The catalog statistic "" for column "HIGH2KEY" is out of range for
its target column, has an invalid format, or is inconsistent in relation to
some other statistic. Reason Code = "3". SQLSTATE=23521
-----
As above, UPDATE SYSSTAT.COLUMNS statement gets SQL1227N at col1 varchar(10).
It is caused by runstats, writes an unexpected HIGH2KEY and LOW2KEY statistic values.

Here is work arounds:

Work around #1
1. $ db2set DB2_STATISTICS=USCC:0
** this variable is available for V10.1 FP4 and above.
2. $ db2 terminate
3. $ db2start
4. $ repro.sh

Work around #2
1. Edit SQO1227N causing UPDATE statements' COLCARD=4 to 3 in db_SAMPLE.sql file.
2. Replay by running "db2 -tvf db_SAMPLE.sql" 

Work around #3
1. Do not insert/import space(s) data, such as " ", " ".

This behavior might be changed without notice in the future. We can confirm whether this technote
is valid or not by following sample scenario above.

 IBM NormalizeCCO merging lines with IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture - United States normalizecco; merge lines; recognition TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After running NormalizeCCO, words on separate lines are merged into a single line of text when using IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture. 

SYMPTOM
In the following image, Word 1 and Word 2 are on separate lines, but after NormalizeCCO is run may show in a single line as Word Word 1 2. 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21701910&amp;aid=1]


CAUSE
When text is not cleanly printed in lines, such as when the font varies or the text is vertically offset, Datacap may not always be able to locate text when loading field values. The NormalizeCCO goes through the CCO file, and cleans up all the entries so they appear in regular lines. For most images this improves ultimate recognition results, but for some complex images, NormalizeCCO cannot determine where to separate the lines and merges all words into a single line.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Add the following action prior to NormalizeCCO. 

 * 
 * 

The first parameter is the percentage of a line that two words must be offset to be considered as separate lines. If the value is not set, the default is 50. In the example, if two words are vertically offset by more than 35% of the height of the words, then they are considered to be on separate lines. Lower values are more likely to split words into separate lines. Higher values are more likely to merge words into a single line.

 IBM Information Server QualityStage Match Designer Database creation - United States MD Match Designer Matching Match InformationServer QualityStage TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I configure the Match Designer Database in Information Server? 

ANSWER
This Technote outlines the following procedures. 

 1. Prerequisites 
 2. What is the Match Database’s purpose? 
 3. Setting the database up. 
 4. Configuring the Match Designer for use with the Database. 
 5. On going maintenance 


Prerequisites 
The following must exist before using the Match Designer functionality.  1. Match Specification built for use in match designer. 
 2. Create a data set that contains the data you will run the match analysis on. 
 3. Create a corresponding frequency data set to be used in the match analysis. 
 4. DSN for local PC 
 5. Create Database in which to perform the Match analysis processing. 
    a) Sizing of Database 
    b) Character sets required 
    c) Permission's for users 


Additional information is also available with in the WebSphere QualityStage User Guide. 

What it’s the Match Database’s purpose?  1. The results Database is used to test the match specifications (logic) designed for use in match jobs. 
 2. This functionality enables the user to get a baseline of how good the match criteria are, based on the match logic developed for use in the application. 
 3. The results Database stores statistics and match results based on your data. For Example: How many matches, duplicates, and unmatched records. 
 4. This functionality allows developers to change matching logic on the fly and retest within minutes. 

 * There is nothing from this Database that is used in production runs so it should never be created on or moved to a production box. 
 * The Match Designer is to be used for development purposes only with a "subset" of the full volume data. If additional match modifications are required continue to use a subset of data not conduct testing with full volume data. 
 * Determining the subset size of data to use in the Match Designer will vary depending on the clients environment and resources. Each client should run several iterations to determine the optimal subset to utilize in the Match Designer step. 
 * To obtain the most accurate matching thresholds a full volume run should be performed in the DataStage Designer.


Creating the Database  1. You should start from an empty Database; using the default XMETA Database is not recommended because it can become corrupt. 
 2. There are certain requirements on how the Database is to be created. 
    a) If Oracle: CHARACTERSET should be set to AL32UTF 
    b) If SQL: default is fine. 
    c) If DB2: create as codepage UTF-8 and page size 32K 
    d) Permission’s - Each user has to have the ability to create tables, write and read rights in the DB. 
    e) The minimum DB space required will be calculated as follows = Number of Passes in match specification (X) Number of Input Records (X) Input Record Length (+) 100 filler.
    f) If this is a distributed installation, you need to have ODBC defined in your client and on the server. They must have the same name. 


Configuring the Match Designer for use with the Database  1.  Via the DataStage Designer navigate to the your match specification to work with 
 2.  Double click and a window will appear indicating: 
     “The ODBC Data Source Name (xxxxxxx) currently specified for this Match could not be found. Please create a DSN by this name or run a Test Environment Update to configure a different DSN for this Specification.” 
 3.  Select the “OK” button 
 4.  Select option “Configure Specification” 
 5.  From drop down select “Test Environment” 
 6.  For “Sample Information” navigate to the location of your data set(s) created for analysis. 
 7.  Under “Frequency Information” navigate to the location of your frequency data set(s) created for use. 
 8.  Section “Test Results Database” fill the following information in. 
     a. Select the DSN created for the will allow the connection to the Database. 
     b. Enter user name required 
     c. Password required 
     d. Test Connection 
     e. Configuration File Location; these are the nodes located in your environment for use. Please make sure this matches the location of where the data sets reside on the server. 
 9.  Once connection is established hit the “Update” button. This will populate the Database with the required fields (not data) to populate when you perform the test specification. 
 10. The final step is to perform the Test All Passes. Please note this make take a few moments depending on the size of the files used. 


Ongoing Maintenance  1. For each new run, results are cleared and rewritten to the DB. 
 2. Each user should have their own respective Databases to avoid rewriting over previous results. 
 3. There are separate tables holding results for each design. And from one user it is no problem to use a single Database and multiple designs. 
 4. Per the recommendation above in "Creating the Database" this database should not be your XMETA database. If you used the XMETA DO NOT RUN THIS STEP. When you are done testing you can drop the DB altogether. 

 IBM DataType incorrect on Secondary - United States netcool; impact; netcool/impact; nci; data; type; datatype; .type; replication; cluster; sync; error; 500; mark; invalid TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The DataType is not being correctly replicated across the ImpactServer Cluster 

SYMPTOM
The .type file of the Secondary ImpactServer configuration is truncated with the error message: 

 * 
 * 


CAUSE
APAR "IZ81446: IMPACT 511 CLUSTER UNABLE TO REPLICATE DATATYPES WITH USERPARMETERS VALUES IN EXCESS OF 16,000 CHARACTERS." [link below] 





RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Additional comments associated with APAR IZ81446 release notes: 


"a new property is added to increase the file size limit:



 * 


Add the property to $NCHOME/impact/etc/<SERVERNAME>_server.props file 
where size limit can be 8192, 16384, 32768, etc.. " 

The property would have to be added to all ImpactServers in the Cluster and would require a restart to enable - ensuring that the ImpactServer started as Primary had the correct, uncorrupted .type file to be replicated across the Cluster. Also ensure that there are no trailing white-space characters on the property as these invalidate properties in lower versions of Impact. 

The APAR is not an issue in Impact 6 and 7, but one would still have to include this property with an appropriate value to handle a large character length for the USERPARAMETERS parameter. 

The character length includes the whole USERPARAMETERS property name as well as the definition. 

For example one would add the property: 

 * 


to the files: 

 * 
 * 
 * 


where one wished to allow the replication of a DataType between two ImpactServers called NCI1 and NCI2 in a Cluster where the USERPARMETERS property line were 20,000 characters long.

 * If using Microsoft Windows, Unix/Linux, or IBM i, run the following script from the <wp_profile_root> [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHRKX_8.5.0/mp/reference/wpsdirstr.dita]/PortalServer/bin/ directory to begin the collection:  * 
    * 
    *  Unix/Linux: wpcollector.sh 
    *  i: wpcollector.sh 
    *  
    * Tip: To specify the option for collecting files for the Deployment Manager profile, use the "dmgr.root" parameter. For example: 
    *  wpcollector.bat -Ddmgr.root=/opt/IBM/WebSphere/profiles/dmgr_profile
   
   
 * If using IBM z/OS, proceed as follows [../reference/wpsdirstr.html%5C]:  * 
    * 
    *  In the Portal configuration panel, select Collect Diagnostics. 
    *  Follow the Customization Dialog instructions for submitting the Collect Diagnostics job (EJPSLOGS). 
    *  
    * Tip: To collect data from the Deployment Manager, the only requirement is to submit the job from the system where the Deployment Manager is installed (i.e. so it can access the files). There is no prompt in the ISPF panel for this.
   
   
 * Locate the wp.mustgather-<timestamp>.zip file in the <wp_profile_root> [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHRKX_8.5.0/mp/reference/wpsdirstr.dita]/filesForAutoPD/ directory and follow the instructions in "Exchanging information with IBM Technical Support for problem determination" [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21153852] to manually FTP the collection to IBM. If using z/OS, there may be additional z/OS-specific files required, such as WebSphere Portal servant region or controller region joblogs. Wpcollector currently does not collect these files. Your L2 Support Engineer will inform you in the event these files are needed and provide instructions for collecting them. 
   


 * If tracing was requested and enabled, please follow the instructions provided by the L2 Support Engineer to disable tracing from the environment

1. Introduction
===============

This feature allows users to define scripts to run at Tivoli Monitoring OS agents sites at a defined frequency.

The feature is enabled by default. The administrator can enable/disable it by setting a new environment variable 
KXX_FCP_SCRIPT=true/false (default true)in the agent configuration file, where XX can be:

- LZ for Linux OS agent 
- UX for Unix OS agent
- NT for Windows OS agent

This is an overview of the scripting feature; details will be provided in the following sections.

The OS agent loops, at a configurable interval, looking for script definition property files (*.properties) in a configurable directory path.
The property files are parsed and OS Monitoring Agent spawns a new process named “fcp_daemon” if at least one valid script definition is found. This new daemon is responsible for scheduling the script executions and gathering all information regarding running scripts.

According to another configurable interval, the OS agent loops getting the execution script results from the fcp_daemon.
The OS Agent is able to parse the script standard output, splitting each row in up to 16 attributes.
An event is sent for each standard output row of the script and these events can be caught by pure event situations.

1.1 Quick Start
================
The feature is enabled with default values as soon as the OS agent is started. The only action to start using the feature is the following:
- create a property file under default directory (on Linux/UNIX is $CANDLEHOME/localconfig/<product code>/scripts_definitions, on Windows is %CANDLE_HOME%\localconfig\nt\scripts_definitions) using as an example the provided template script_property.txt.

Only two properties are required:
ATTRIBUTE_NAME=Any name used to uniquely identify the script definition inside the property file.
SCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS=The fully qualified path of the script with arguments. 

Not only shell scripts but also perl and other types of scripts can be used. You just need to specify the full command to execute in the SCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS property. 
For example, "perl C:\IBM\scripts\ITM_Custom_Scripts\date.pl". In this example you need to make sure that the location of "perl" can be resolved by the agent through the PATH variable in its environment. Specify the full path where "perl" is installed otherwise.

Further properties and details can be found in this document and in the template script_property.txt under $CANDLEHOME/localconfig/lz/scripts_definitions. 


2. New Attribute groups
=======================

Two new attribute groups have been added for this feature as detailed below. Statistic and execution data of all the scripts are stored in these two tables. The name of the property file (Property_File) and the attribute name defined in the property file (Attribute_Name) are the 2 key fields of these two tables. These two keys must be used in situation conditions to filter rows related to a specific script.

Attribute group: KXX_Custom_Scripts (multiple rows), table: KXXSCRPTS (sampled).
Description: Configuration and statistic data gathered using custom scripts. It contains a row for each defined script, information on the fcp_daemon and on property files:

3. Parameters in OS agent environment files
===========================================

It is possible to customize the feature setting parameters in the OS agent environment files:
- $CANDLEHOME/config/lz.ini file for the Linux OS agent
- $CANDLEHOME/config/ux.ini for the UNIX OS agent
- %CANDLE_HOME%\TMAITM6_x64\KNTENV for Windows 64bit OS agent
- %CANDLE_HOME%\TMAITM6\KNTENV for Windows 32bit OS agent

The scripting feature is enabled by default. To disable it set:
- KXX_FCP_SCRIPT=false

Other parameters can be defined inside the agent environment files based on specific needs:

- KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_DEFINITIONS (default location on Linux/UNIX is $CANDLEHOME/localconfig/<product code>/scripts_definitions, on Windows it is %CANDLE_HOME%\localconfig\nt\scripts_definitions)
The location where property files are stored.

- KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_INTERVAL (default 60 sec)
OS agent uses the value of this variable as loop interval in seconds to check execution of running scripts and it sends events if the filter condition is satisfied. The minimum value is 30 seconds, the maximum value is 300 seconds. Invalid values will be reset to the default.
Note: this parameter is ignored if KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_SYNC_INTERVALS is set to USE_SCRIPT (see definition below).

- KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_SYNC_INTERVALS (USE_AGENT|USE_SCRIPT|NO - default USE_AGENT)
If the agent looping interval defined by KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_INTERVAL is bigger than the script execution frequency, it can happen that data produced by some of the script execution loops is lost.
To avoid this behaviour the script execution frequency can be synchronized with the agent looping interval setting the KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_SYNC_INTERVALS to:
- USE_AGENT; the value of each script execution frequency is forced to be the maximum between KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_INTERVAL and EXECUTION_FREQUENCY defined in its property file. 
- USE_SCRIPT; the agent looping interval is dynamically set to the minimum frequency value (EXECUTION_FREQUENCY in property file) between all of the defined scripts . The value set by KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_INTERVAL is ignored. The frequency of the scripts remain the ones defined in the property files. When using USE_SCRIPT, the agent looping interval may change every time a script definition is added, changed or removed. In any case, it cannot be lower than the value set by KXX_FCP_OVERRIDE_MIN_FREQUENCY_LIMIT or bigger than 300 seconds.
- NO; no synchronization is performed and some execution results could be lost.

- KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_DEFINITIONS_CHECK_INTERVAL (default 300 sec) 
At startup and at every interval defined by this variable, the OS agent checks for any changes in scripts or property files.
Note that if KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_DEFINITIONS_CHECK_INTERVAL is less than the agent looping interval it will be reset to the agent looping interval. The maximum allowed value is the default, 300 seconds.

- KXX_FCP_USER (default OS agent user)
This parameter is valid only on linux and unix platforms. It defines the user used to spawn fcp_deamon process if different from OS agent process user; all the scripts are executed by this user. Note that the user owner of the OS agent must have correct permission to spawn the fcp_daemon process. On windows a different user must be defined as login of the service "Monitoring Agent for Windows OS - FCProvider". The user must have "Full Control" permission to CANDLE_HOME and scripts repository directories. For more information please refer to official IBM Monitoring documentation: 
http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSTFXA_6.3.0.2/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3fp2/oswin/running_as_a_non-admin_user.htm [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSTFXA_6.3.0.2/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3fp2/oswin/running_as_a_non-admin_user.htm]

- KXX_FCP_MAX_CDP_DP_THREAD_POOL_SIZE (default 10)
It defines the maximum concurrent number of scripts to be executed. Maximum value is 32.

- KXX_FCP_MAX_DAEMON_RESTARTS (default 4)
The OS agent watches the fcp_daemon: if an abnormal exit of process occurs, the OS agent restarts it. This is done for the KXX_FCP_MAX_DAEMON_RESTARTS (times at a day). 
The value 0 must be used to avoid the restart; if -1 is set, the OS agent retries to restart fcp_daemon forever. The restart counter is reset at OS agent restart.

- KXX_FCP_SEND_SCRIPT_RUNTIME_EVENTS (default: true)
If set to false, the OS agent stops sending events for each row of script standard output. In this case script outputs are visible on TEP console workspaces but no situations will be displayed and no historical collection data will be collected. 

- KXX_FCP_OVERRIDE_MIN_FREQUENCY_LIMIT (default: 5 seconds) 
It is used when KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_SYNC_INTERVALS is set to USE_SCRIPT. In this condition, it sets the minimum value of the OS agent looping interval.
Using low values for the the OS agent looping interval (less than 5 seconds) is highly invasive and can impact OS agent performances. If a frequent data collection is needed (e.g. every second), it is strongly suggested to customize a script that caches data at the needed frequency and returns the collected data to the OS agent at an higher interval (e.g. every 60 seconds).


The following Agent Builder (CDP) variables can also be used to control the behavior of the fcp_daemon:

- CDP_DP_REFRESH_INTERVAL (default 60 sec) Global script scheduled start time. Used if the frequency is not passed in the script property file.

- CDP_DP_SCRIPT_TIMEOUT (default 30 sec) Global script execution maximum time. When the execution time of a script exceeds this limit, its Status_Code is set to TIMEOUT

- CDP_DP_KILL_ORPHAN_SCRIPTS (Y|N - default N) Global behaviour used by fcp_daemon process for timing out scripts. When set to 'Y', the scripts are killed, otherwise they are abandoned. This value is ignored for a specific script if the KILL_AFTER_TIMEOUT key is set in the script property file

- CDP_MAXIMUM_ROW_COUNT_FOR_CPCI_DATA_RESPONSES (default 1000) Global value added for performance reasons to limit the maximum number of output rows returned by the scripts. Additional rows after this limit are ignored. Allowed values are positive integer. Invalid values means no limit.

The fcp_daemon also supports the other environment variables used to control Agent Builder agents. For a complete list see the official Agent Builder documentation here:
http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v61r1/topic/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3/agentbuilder63_user.pdf [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v61r1/topic/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3/agentbuilder63_user.pdf]

4. Parameters in property files 
===============================

The KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_DEFINITIONS directory contains a list of *.properties files. Each property file contains a list of 
scripts to run with respective properties in the form of key=value. The properties that can be defined (case in-sensitive) are: 

- ATTRIBUTE_NAME (Required - string max 256 characters).
It is a name of your choice that defines a specific script and its attributes. The characters that can be used for the 
ATTRIBUTE NAME name can be alphabetical, numeric and only the underscore can be used as a special character. If other special characters (even a blank is considered this way) are used they get converted into underscore (_).
When multiple scripts are listed inside the same property file, more different ATTRIBUTE_NAME must be defined (one for each script). It must be the first value specified for each defined script and delimits the start of the properties set for the specific script until the next ATTRIBUTE_NAME.

- SCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS (Required - string max 512 characters).
It defines the full path to the script with parameters, separated by a blank. No special characters can be used in the script path name. 
Values containing blanks must be enclosed in single (') or double quotes (").
Environment variables can be passed, but only enclosed in ${...} for all the platforms. Environment variables must be available in the OS agent process context.

- EXECUTION_FREQUENCY (Optional - default 60 sec).
It indicates the script execution frequency.

- CUSTOM_NAME (Optional - string max 256 characters)
The user can fill it with a description of the script.

- IS_ACTIVE (true|false - Optional - default true). 
It activates the script. If false, the script is not executed.

- DISABLE_USE_AGENT_SYNC (true|false - Optional - default false). If true, the EXECUTION_FREQUENCY of the script is respected also if the global variable KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_SYNC_INTERVALS is set to USE_AGENT.

- KILL_AFTER_TIMEOUT (true|false - Optional - default value defined by the CDP_DP_KILL_ORPHAN_SCRIPTS variable). 
When true the script is killed after timeout (a timeout occurs when script execution is greater than the value specified by CDP_DP_SCRIPT_TIMEOUT parameter in OS agent configuration file) otherwise it is ignored. In both cases no data is collected. Note that when KILL_AFTER_TIMEOUT is set, only the script defined in property file is killed and not child processes (if any) spawned by the script. This feature is not supported by Solaris and Windows 32 bit OS agents and any timing out scripts are abandoned. 


Output rows returned by a script are parsed. The script returns a standard output (called hereafter as first token). When the script returns more values in the output row they are added as additional tokens for a maximum of 5 strings, 5 integers and 5 floats following a predefined syntax as described below:

- OUTPUT_TYPE (STRING|INTEGER|FLOAT - Optional - default string). It defines the type of the first token returned by each row of the script;
OUTPUT_TYPE can be:
1. STRING (default): strings up to 2048 characters. When used, the "Standard_Output_String" attribute of KXX_Custom_Scripts_Runtime is filled in by the first token.
2. INTEGER: allows getting numeric values between -9223372036854775806 and 9223372036854775806. When used, the "Standard_Output_Integer" attribute of KXX_Custom_Scripts_Runtime is filled in by the first token.
3. FLOAT: allows getting numeric values between -92233720368547758.06 and 92233720368547758.06,(with 2 decimal
precision). When used, the "Standard_Output_Float" attribute of KXX_Custom_Scripts_Runtime is filled in by the first token.

- TOKEN_TYPES (STRING|INTEGER|FLOAT - Optional).
It defines the output type of additional tokens after the first one. The user can define a maximum of 5 strings, 5 integers and 5 floats. It is a list of types separated by commas:
<token_type>,<token_type>,…
token_type can be empty or one from (case insensitive):
- STRING or S
- INTEGER or I
- FLOAT or F
If <token_type> is empty, the corresponding token is skipped.
Examples of the same valid layouts:
- TOKEN_TYPES=S,I,S,,,F,,F,F
- TOKEN_TYPES=String,integer,S,,,Float,,f,FLOAT

- TOKEN_LABELS (STRING - maximum 16 characters each label - Optional). 
It defines the labels of the tokens defined in TOKEN_TYPES. This value is a list of token labels separated
by commas, and must correspond to the tokens defined by TOKEN_TYPES. 
e.g.:
- TOKEN_TYPES=S,I,S,,,F,,F,F
- TOKEN_LABELS=Cpu Name,Cpu number,Description,,,value 1,,value 2,value 3 
It is ignored if TOKEN_TYPES is not set.

- TOKEN_SEPARATOR (Optional - default semicolon ";"). 
It sets the string to be used as separator to split the output row in tokens. It is ignored if TOKEN_TYPES is not set. Empty value (blank) is accepted as separator and multiple consecutive blanks in output rows are considered as a single one.


The following two parameters allow you to filter the rows output of a script; they are applied by the OS agent only to the first token and they must be used together:

- FILTER_VALUE (Optional).
The value used for comparison. It is required if FILTER_OPERATOR is defined.
If the OUTPUT_TYPE is a string, the filter value must reflect exactly the string value returned by the script that is intended to be filtered, without any additional quotes (no wildcards allowed).
- FILTER_OPERATOR (Optional).
The operator used for the comparison. It is required if FILTER_VALUE is defined. Accepted FILTER_OPERATOR values include:
= (equal to)
!= (different from)
> (bigger than) only for numeric type
>= (not lower than) only for numeric type
< (lower than) only for numeric type
<= (not bigger than) only for numeric type



5. Examples of property file
============================

#First script definition: script ex_script1.sh is launched every 150 seconds, it returns float values and only the output rows equal to 0.5 will be considered by the agent.

ATTRIBUTE_NAME=sample1 
SCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS=/opt/ibm/itmd4255a/localconfig/lz/scripts_definitions/ex_script1.sh
EXECUTION_FREQUENCY=150
OUTPUT_TYPE=FLOAT
FILTER_VALUE=0.5
FILTER_OPERATOR==

#Second script definition: script ex_script2 is launched every 60 seconds, it returns integer values and only the rows different from 0 will be considered by the agent.

ATTRIBUTE_NAME=ex_script2
SCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS=${CANDLE_HOME}/tmp/check_out.sh
EXECUTION_FREQUENCY=60
OUTPUT_TYPE=INTEGER
FILTER_VALUE=0
FILTER_OPERATOR=!=

#Third script definition: script ex_script3.sh is launched every 120 seconds with 3 input parameters (the first input parameter is an integer, the second and third are string). It's killed if it hangs or if the execution time is greater than the timeout value.

ATTRIBUTE_NAME=ex_script3 
SCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS=/opt/scripts/ex_script3.sh 1 "second input parameter" "third input parameter" 
EXECUTION_FREQUENCY=120
OUTPUT_TYPE=STRING
KILL_AFTER_TIMEOUT=TRUE

#Fourth script definition: script cpu_mem_percentage.sh is launched every 50 seconds and returns the cpuid as standard output string and 2 float for Idle and Used CPU percentage and 2 integers for Memory and Virtual Memory usage. The pipe is used as separator to parse the output. An example of row that must be returned by the script is: 
cpu2|35,5|65,5|3443|123800

ATTRIBUTE_NAME=cpu and mem Usage
SCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS=${SCRIPT_HOME}/cpu_mem_percentage.sh
OUTPUT_TYPE=STRING
TOKEN_TYPES=F,F,I,I
TOKEN_LABELS= Idle CPU %, Used CPU %, Virt MEM used MB, MEM used MB
TOKEN_SEPARATOR=|
EXECUTION_FREQUENCY=50

6. Examples of private situations 
==================================

The private situations definitions can be inserted into the xx_situations.xml under $CANDLEHOME/localconfig/lz for linux or $CANDLEHOME/localconfig/ux for unix or %CANDLE_HOME%\localconfig\nt for Windows to monitor scripts execution.
Examples below are for the Linux OS agent:

<PRIVATESIT>
<!-- Sends an alert if the script defined by attribute name "demo" in property file "demo.properties" returns a row equal to "demo.log" -->
<SITUATION>FCP_CheckLOGFileExists_pr</SITUATION>
<criteria>
<![CDATA[*VALUE KLZ_Custom_Scripts_Runtime.Property_File *EQ 'demo.properties' *AND *VALUE KLZ_Custom_Scripts_Runtime.Attribute_Name *EQ 'demo' *AND *VALUE KLZ_Custom_Scripts_Runtime.Standard_Output_String *EQ 'demo.log']]>
</CRITERIA>
</PRIVATESIT>

<PRIVATESIT>
<!-- Sends an alert if a script exits with a return code different from zero -->
<SITUATION>FCP_ScriptRetCode_pr</SITUATION>
<CRITERIA>
<![CDATA[*IF *VALUE KLZ_Custom_Scripts.Return_Code *NE 0]]>
</CRITERIA>
</PRIVATESIT>

<privatesit>
<!-- Sends an alert when script path is not defined in a property file -->
<SITUATION NAME="FCP_NOPTAH" INTERVAL="000030" ></SITUATION>
<criteria>
<![CDATA[*VALUE KLZ_Custom_Scripts.Status_Code *EQ NO_SCRIPT_PATH]]>
</criteria>
</privatesit>

<privatesit>
<!-- Sends an alert when a script cannot be launched -->
<SITUATION NAME="FCP_ScriptLaunchErr" INTERVAL="000060" ></SITUATION>
<criteria>
<![CDATA[*VALUE KLZ_Custom_Scripts.Status_Code *EQ SCRIPT_LAUNCH_ERROR]]>
</criteria>
</privatesit>


7. Custom Scripts and Custom Scripts Runtime Workspaces
=======================================================

A new OS agent navigation item has been added in the TEP console. It contains two workspaces: "Custom Scripts" and "Custom Scripts Runtime". 

"Custom Scripts" workspace contains the following views:
- "Factory Daemon Status" table view showing informational/warning/error events related to the fcp_daemon process.
- "Properties Files error" table view showing problems related to property files.
- "Number of execution per script" bar chart view summarizing the executions of defined scripts
- "Defined Scripts" table view showing detailed information of defined scripts.

"Custom Scripts Runtime" workspace is called clicking on the anchor of a specific script and provides information on script execution. The views provided by default on the TEP console are to be intended as example workspaces with all available custom attributes. Users can duplicate and customize workspaces to filter out fields that are not needed according to the output returned by their scripts.


8. Known problems and limitations
===================================

- The Scripting Feature is not supported on Windows 2003 64-bit systems.
- Kill after timeout does not work on Solaris and Windows 32 bit OS agents.
- The fcp_daemon may stop executing scripts in Windows 32 bit If some scripts do not complete within the time out period and the user has turned on intensive tracing. If this happens the data reported on the TEP will reflect the last time the script was actually run. It is also possible that the OS agent will stop returning data. Terminating the fcp_daemon process will allow the agent to resume proper operation.
- SCRIPT_NONZERO_RETURN is returned instead of SCRIPT_NOT_FOUND or SCRIPT_LAUNCH_ERROR on Solaris.
- The scripting feature does not provide full Native Language Support; some issues may be found using Nationalized characters in property files or script outputs.
- On windows OS agent there is no possibility of executing scripts residing on a mapped network drive.

9. Troubleshooting
===================

Standard KBB_RAS1 variable will apply to the OS agent and to the fcp_daemon processes.
To apply a specific trace setting to fcp_daemon only, use the KXX_FCP_KBB_RAS1 variable; when KXX_FCP_KBB_RAS1 is set, the value specified by KBB_RAS1 is ignored by fcp_daemon.

To trace the operations logged by the OS agent core threads of the feature:
KBB_RAS1=ERROR (UNIT:factory ALL)

To trace scripting queries from the ITM server and events sent to the server, add the entries:
(UNIT:klz34 ALL) (UNIT:klz35 ALL) on Linux OS agent
(UNIT:kux48 ALL) (UNIT:kux49 ALL) on Unix OS agent
(UNIT:knt84 ALL) (UNIT:knt85 ALL) on Windows OS agent

To view tema traces to verify private situation execution, add the entries:
(UNIT:kraavp all) (UNIT:kraapv all)

To see the execution of the scripts and how the data from the scripts is being parsed set:
KXX_FCP_KBB_RAS1=Error (UNIT:command ALL)

To troubleshoot problems in the communication between the os agent and fcp_daemon add this trace level to both KBB_RAS1 and KXX_FCP_KBB_RAS1:
(UNIT:cps_socket FLOW) (UNIT:cpci FLOW)

To see the interaction between the OS agent process and the fcp_daemon in detail add to both KBB_RAS1 and KXX_FCP_KBB_RAS1:
(UNIT:cps_socket ALL) (UNIT:cpci ALL)


10. Quick Start Scenario
=========================

The following section describes the minimum steps needed to configure a linux OS agent to run 2 custom scripts.

Custom Scripts descriptions
===========================
Let's suppose the user has 2 scripts under a directory /scripts_repo:

- checkDIRsize.sh that checks the size of a specified directory passed as input parameter. Its output is an integer like the following: 

4594740

- cpu_mem_usage.sh that checks the used CPU percentages and used Swap Memory megabytes. Its output is returned in the following form:

cpu1|96,5|23800

where the first token is the CPU id, the second token is the used CPU percentage, the third token is the used swap memory in megabyte.

Customization needed to have the linux OS agent run above scripts
==============================================================
The feature is enabled with default values as soon as the OS agent is started:

- you could create one or two property files (<Any Name>.properties)under the default directory $CANDLEHOME/localconfig/lz/scripts_definitions. In this example let's create 2 property files one for each script called checkDIRsize.properties and cpu_mem_usage.properties:

#CheckDIRsize.properties
ATTRIBUTE_NAME=OPT_DIR_SIZE
SCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS=/scripts_repo/checkDIRsize.sh /opt
EXECUTION_FREQUENCY=20
OUTPUT_TYPE=INTEGER

#cpu_mem_usage.properties 
ATTRIBUTE_NAME=cpu_mem_usage
SCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS=/scripts_repo/cpu_mem_percentage.sh
OUTPUT_TYPE=string
TOKEN_TYPES=F,I
TOKEN_LABELS= Used CPU %, Swap MEM used MB
TOKEN_SEPARATOR=|
EXECUTION_FREQUENCY=10

- There is no need to restart the OS agent after adding (or changing) the 2 property files above: the OS agent checks script definition directory with a specified time interval (default value 300 seconds). Open the TEP console and under the "Custom Scripts" workspace the scripts details and results are shown.

 IBM HTTP Session time-out settings and overwrite precedence rules - United States WebSphere http session management time-out wasrun precedence overwrite TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 It is possible to set the HTTP Session time-out in various places on the IBM® WebSphere® Application Server Administrative Console. It is also possible to set HTTP Session time-out for the application packaging process. 

Since Session time-out can be set in multiple places, it is necessary to understand how the ultimate Session time-out for an application is determined. 

CAUSE
Application needs HTTP session time-out set.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The HTTP Session time-out can be set in the following places: 

 * From the Administrative Console at the server, Enterprise application, and Web application levels 
 * At the time when the application is packaged 
 * In the application code


Setting the HTTP Session time-out from the Administrative Console 
1. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the server level, navigate to Servers > Application Servers > Your Server > Web Container > Session Management. 

In the Session time-out section of this window, you can select No time-out or Set time-out by clicking the appropriate radio button. If you choose to set the time-out, type the desired value in minutes in the box. 


2. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the Enterprise Application level, navigate to Applications > Enterprise Applications > Your Application > Session Management. 

Check Override in the Override Session Management section, then select to set the time-out and the time-out value. This sets the application session to overwrite those values set at the parent, which in this case is the Server level. 


3. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the Web Application level, navigate to Applications > Enterprise Applications > Your Application > Web Module > Your Web App.war > Session Management. 

Check Override in the Override Session Management section, then select to set the time-out and the time-out value. This sets the Application Session to overwrite those values set at the parent levels, which in this case is the Server or Enterprise Application level. 

After modifying these settings, save the master configuration. 

Setting HTTP Session time-out when application is packaged 

The application developer can also select to set the HTTP Session time-out parameter when the application is packaged. This value is stored in the web.xml file for the Web application. 

This setting overrides any session time-outs defined from the Administrative Console. Alter this setting by repackaging the application with a new value, or by modifying the web.xml file. The entry in the web.xml will be as follows: 
          <session-config> 
      *          <session-timeout>60</session-timeout>
 * 
 *       </session-config>

 

Where the "session-timeout" is an integer value for the desired session time-out in minutes. 
Setting HTTP Session time-out from the application code 

Finally, the HTTP Session time-out can be set in the application code. The programmer can invoke the setMaxInactiveInterval() method on HttpSession object to set the time-out value as desired. This setting overrides any time-out defined in the application package or made from the Administrative Console. 

HTTP Session time-out Override Precedence Summary 

The list below shows the precedence from which the final HTTP Session time-out is derived. 

1. Server Level [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21163875&amp;aid=1] Lowest level 2. Enterprise Application [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21163875&amp;aid=1] Overrides the Server Level if Override is selected 3. Web Application [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21163875&amp;aid=1] Overrides the Server and Enterprise Application settings if Override is selected 4. Application Level (web.xml) [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21163875&amp;aid=1] Overrides Server, Enterprise Application, and Web Application settings 5. Application Code [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21163875&amp;aid=1] Overrides all other settings RELATED INFORMATION

 IBM EventReader stops reading events, StateChange value too high - United States netcool; impact; netcool/impact; nci; event; reader; eventreader; omnibus; omni; omnibuseventreader; state; change; statechange; date; time; datetime; value; future; high; stamp; timestamp; advanced; advance; forward; ahead; before; after; current; jrexec; jrexecaction; jrexecserver; jrexecaction()' server; action; function; command; line; interface; cli; commandlineinterface TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How to deal with an EventReader that is using an inadvertently future dated StateChange value. 

SYMPTOM
The EventReader stops acquiring events that are pertinent for processing because it is using a StateChange value that is too high.


CAUSE
An event has had its StateChange value artificially increased by some unknown component (Probe, Trigger, etc) to reflect a future date. The EventReader captures the event and then uses the highest captured StateChange value in its outgoing SQL to capture pertinent events.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Pertinent events are not being processed. Looking in the EventReader log file the number of events being captured in each Read is 0. Testing the SQL being used in an nco_sql session produces a 0 result too. Testing the SQL again in an nco_sql session without the "and StateChange >= 1234567890" clause returns all the unprocessed rows.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Something has "future dated" the StateChange value of an event in the ObjectServer, the EventReader captured the event and, since the EventReader will use the highest StateChange value captured in the previous poll in the SQL of its next poll, this then future dated the value used in the EventReader. The EventReader will persist with this value (and will increment it by 1 every other poll) until such a time as it captures an event with a higher StateChange value.





The simplest solution is to manually reset the EventReader StateChange value via the GUI. Stop the EventReader, open it for edit, click the "Clear State" button, exit the editor and restart the EventReader.

An alternate solution is to perform this operation via the Command Line Interface:



 * telnet [Hostname] [Port]


where [Hostname] is the resolvable hostname of the ImpactServer host and [Port] is the CLI port number (2000, by default). You will need to supply a suitable username (admin, for example) and password. Then at the READY prompt enter the series of commands: 

 * Update Service set Running=false where Name='[EventReaderName]';
 * 
 * Update Service set ClearState=true where Name='[EventReaderName]';
 * 
 * Update Service set Running=true where Name='[EventReaderName]';


where [EventReaderName] is the name of the EventReader that requires this restart process. 

In cases where the likelihood of StateChange being inappropriately incremented in this fashion is quite high, one might wish to automate this process and have a Policy hunt for such occurrences. Please find following an example of a "hunter" Policy to capture any reoccurrence of this issue:

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Log(3,ID+ANN+": No UnprocessedEvents"); 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


As you can see this is designed to be run by a PolicyActivator and checks for events that have been around in the ObjectServer for a while (a minute) and are pertinent for processing by Impact (ImpactFlag = 1), but have not. If it finds any it then acquires the StateChange value from the .state file via JRExecServer using the example script referred to in the above example Policy as CheckState.sh: 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


If the Policy finds the string it extracts the StateChange value and compares it against the current time and, if StateChange exceeds the current time, it undertakes the stop, clear and restart of the EventReader to bring StateChange back into line. 

This examples a simple script to use the Command Line Interface to stop the EventReader, clear the StateChange value and restart the EventReader and is referred to in the above exampled Policy as ClearState.sh: 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


Please note that the ClearState.sh script should not contain any spaces or special characters otherwise calling EOF will throw errors. Also, in latter versions of Impact, the username and password should be those of the tipadmin. Additionally, rather than have the password sitting clear case in a script one can pass it as a JRExecAction Parameter from the Policy - still clear case but the relevance of the variable can be made less obvious. 

Both of these scripts are called by the JRExecAction() function in the example Policy and this in turn requires the JRExecServer to be running on the ImpactServer host(s *). 

* - The JRExecServer will be used by the current Primary ImpactServer only, as all EventReaders and PolicyActivators are run on the current Primary only but, if and when failover occurs and the Secondary ImpactServer becomes Primary, this new Primary will require access to a running, local JRExecServer. So, JRExecServer has to be running on both Primary and Secondary ImpactServer hosts to ensure availability in case of failover. Some additional information about the JRExecAction() function is available from the TechNote "JRExecAction() function usage" [Link Below]

 IBM When to enable Conversation Sharing in DataPower MQ Queue Manager (mq-qm) object - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When to enable Sharing Conversations in DataPower MQ Queue Manager (mq-qm) object along with SHARECNV attribute of the MQ SVRCONN channel? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
IBM WebSphere MQ server version 7.0 and later releases provide sharing conversations (SHARECNV) attribute on SVRCONN channel that specifies the maximum number of conversations that can share each TCP/IP channel instance. This feature can be configured in DataPower as it uses client connection with queue manager SVRCONN channel. 
The default setting of sharing conversations (SHARECNV) value is zero in DataPower mq-qm object. The same default value for MQ SVRCONN channel is 10. The sharing conversations value is 
negotiated between MQ server and DataPower and the lower value takes effect. However, in current versions of the DataPower firmware, the sharing conversations setting of 1 is treated as 0 when negotiating with MQ server.

There are three use cases to configure Sharing Conversations in DataPower mq-qm object: 

Case #1 : The negotiated sharing conversations value is 0 - The channel runs in a mode similar to WebSphere MQ V6 and does not uses features such as

· Administrator stop-quiesce
· Heartbeating 
· Read ahead 
· Client asynchronous consume

Set a value of 0 or 1 on the Sharing Conversations attribute of the mq-qm object in DataPower to disable sharing conversations regardless of the IBM WebSphere MQ SVRCONN setting.

Case #2: The negotiated sharing conversations value is 1 - The channel supports IBM WebSphere MQ V7 and later release features as outlined in case #1, but each TCP/IP channel instance has a single conversation.

Set a value of 1 on the Sharing Conversations attribute and select "on" in Share Single Conversation attribute of the mq-qm object in DataPower as shown in the following picture and a value of 1 on IBM WebSphere MQ SVRCONN setting.

The Share Single Conversation attribute is only visible when "Sharing Conversations" is configured with value of "1" and then <RETURN> key is entered. For values greater than 1, the "Share Single Conversation" attribute is hidden in the mq-qm object.
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21647231&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21647231&aid=1] 

Case #3: The negotiated sharing conversations value is 2 or more - The channel supports IBM WebSphere MQ 7 and later release features and each TCP/IP channel instance supports 2 or more conversations.

Set a value of 2 or more on the Sharing Conversations attribute of the mq-qm object in DataPower and on the MQ SVRCONN channel.

On average, processing of messages from client applications is 15 percent slower when using SHARECNV(10) as compared to SHARECNV(0). Please refer to Performance Implications of Sharing [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_7.0.1/com.ibm.mq.csqzaf.doc/mi12240_.htm]
Conversations on Client-connection Channels. [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_7.0.1/com.ibm.mq.csqzaf.doc/mi12240_.htm].

Since DataPower uses a connection pool in processing MQ messages, there are no additional benefits of using sharing conversations with the mq-qm object. However, in situations when mixed message sizes are used by the same mq-qm object, using case #2 will benefit mq-qm object as it will use new buffer management feature of IBM WebSphere MQ Version 7 when making MQGET API call.

When using a negotiated shared conversations value of 0 as in case #1, mq-qm object uses maximum message size as the buffer pool for the MQGET API call. However, when mixed message sizes are processed by the same MQ Front Side Handler (FSH), it requests buffer pool based on maximum message size configured in the mq-qm object. The use of fixed buffer pool for small and large messages can deplete MQ server's allocated buffer and contribute to unexpected termination of MQ SVRCONN channel instance and may terminate the queue manager. In such a situation, using a negotiated sharing conversations value of 1 as in case #2 will benefit DataPower mq-qm object as it will use IBM WebSphere MQ Version 7 Read Ahead feature and the new buffer management feature for MQGET API call. IBM WebSphere MQ V8 release provides enhanced performance for case #2, when the negotiated sharing conversations value is 1.

For DataPower firmware releases 7.0.0.x, 7.1.0.x, 7.2.0.x and earlier, one should follow case #1 and use a negotiated sharing conversations value of 0. If you configure these firmware versions with case #2 or case #3, DataPower device may reload or hang due to connection instability and generate many MQ errors with Reason Code - 2009 and 2059. 

Cases #2 and #3 can be used in firmware releases 7.5.0.x, 7.5.1.x and later. We suggest to use a value of 10 or less in Sharing Conversations attribute of the mq-qm object and verify the configuration empirically to make sure that IBM WebSphere MQ server can sustain load from DataPower with the negotiated Sharing Conversations of 10.

Note: In order to use sharing conversations, make sure you have applied APAR IV24821 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV24821] ("Client C application process hangs after cancelling thread") to the IBM WebSphere MQ server. IV24821 is included in IBM WebSphere MQ V7.0.1.10 and later, IBM WebSphere MQ V7.1.0.3 and later, IBM WebSphere MQ V7.5.0.1 and later, and IBM WebSphere MQ V8.

In order to identify the negotiated Sharing Conversations status, the following MQ commands are used in the distributed platform.

runmqsc <qmgr>
display chs(CHANNEL3) maxshcnv curshcnv

display chs(CHANNEL3) maxshcnv curshcnv

 IBM Recreate all the Oracle Text indexes - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I recreate all the Oracle Text indexes for the Atlas database 

ANSWER
There are situations where the Oracle Text indexes used by the application may need to be recreated. For example, after importing data from a production database to a test database, the Oracle Text indexes will not be transferred. This will require you to recreate them in order for certain functions in Atlas to work properly. 

If you have access to the Atlas release files from the version you are currently using you can follow these instructions. You will need the ability to access the Atlas database using the Oracle SQL Plus tool. 

 

 1. Shutdown the application server running the Atlas applications. 
 2. Locate the script drop_ctxsys_indexes.sql to drop the Oracle Text indexes from the following folder in the Atlas release:
    Atlas\Schema\Deploy\smf\db\etc\oracle 
 3. Open up a command window to that directory and execute the script using SQL Plus:
    sqlplus <user>/<password>@<database> @drop_ctxsys_indexes.sql 
 4. Locate the scripts, setup_ctxsys_objects.sql and create_ctxsys_indexes.sql, used to create the Oracle Text preferences and indexes from the following folder in the Atlas release. The <version> folder will differ depending on which version you are currently running.
    Atlas\Schema\Deploy\smf\db\release\<version>\oracle\create\schema 
 5. Open up a command window to that directory and execute the scripts using SQL Plus.
    sqlplus <user>/<password>@<database> @setup_ctxsys_objects.sql
    sqlplus <user>/<password>@<database> @create_ctxsys_indexes.sql 
 6. Start the application server running the Atlas applications.

 IBM Deploying IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture on a WAN - United States WAN LAN architecture deployment TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What are the best practices for deploying Datacap servers and clients on a wide area network (WAN)? 

ANSWER
Remote users that access Datacap over a WAN can use Taskmaster Web-based "thin clients", or FastDoc Capture operating in offline mode. Datacap thick clients (DotScan, DotEdit) and utilities (NENU, Fingerprint Maintenance Tool) require LAN communication speeds and low latency for responsive performance. 

Connect all Datacap Taskmaster Servers, Rulerunner Servers, Web Servers, file servers and databases to a single high performance LAN for best results. Network delays between Taskmaster Server, shared files and databases causes degraded performance of Job Monitor and data intensive operations. 

Some customers successfully operate Datacap thick clients in remote sites using Citrix or other remote access technology. IBM has not tested or sought certification with Citrix, and does not provide support for Citrix. If you deploy Datacap clients on Citrix and encounter issues, IBM may require you to reproduce the issues outside of Citrix as part of the investigation. 

Consult the IBM Redbooks titled "Implementing Imaging Solutions with IBM Production Imaging Edition and IBM Datacap Capture", section 2.5, for deployment recommendations and diagrams.

 IBM WebSphere Application Server Is Leap Year Compliant - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 We have had questions from clients planning for leap year years (containing February 29th) asking if WebSphere Application Server Leap Year Compliant, and if any problems are expected stemming from WebSphere Application Server or associated IBM products due to Leap Year. 

There are no known or expected problems.
(Details below) 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
WebSphere Application Server and the SDK are leap year compliant. IBM Java (SDK / JDK) has been doing leap year testing/verification since 1996, including the non-leap year 2000 without a problem. Basically leap years in Java are explicitly supported by the GregorianCalendar class - that is it's function - and this class is tested with every release of Java as it is part of Java's core functionality. So any Java code which uses the GregorianCalendar class will behave correctly. 

WebSphere Application Server performs no specific leap year testing since it runs on top of the SDK which is compliant, and uses function from it. We are not aware of any issues in the past with WebSphere Application Server associated with leap year. 

From a JDK perspective, Java applications which use the GregorianCalendar class will be leap-year compliant - see the spec at: 

(Same info in the links for the various JDK's) 

http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/GregorianCalendar.html [http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/GregorianCalendar.html] 

http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/GregorianCalendar.html [http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/GregorianCalendar.html]

http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/GregorianCalendar.html [http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/GregorianCalendar.html] 


Specifically: 

"The only difference between the Gregorian and the Julian calendar is the leap year rule. The Julian calendar specifies leap years every four years, whereas the Gregorian calendar omits century years which are not divisible by 400." In other words the Gregorian Calendar follows modern leap years. The correct operation of the class is tested by the Java Compliance Kit (JCK) which is run against every release of the JVM. So Java applications would need to assert that they are using GregorianCalendars to claim leap-year compliance.

 IBM Current Date function for DB2, SQL Server and Oracle - United States TPAEMSSQL; TPAEDB2; getdate; TPAEDATABASE; TPAEORACLE TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What would be the equivalent of MSSQL getdate() function for Maximo running on DB2 or Oracle? 

ANSWER
The getdate() MSSQL function can be replaced by value from DB2 CURRENT DATE special register. On Oracle, sysdate is used to retrieve the current date. 

EXAMPLE : MSSQL and transdate <= ( getdate() - 35) 

 DB2 and transdate <= ( CURRENT DATE - 35 DAYS) 

 Oracle and transdate <= ( sysdate - 35)

 IBM A CWSXM0100E error is received for WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus (WESB), WebSphere Process Server (WPS), or IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Advanced - United States CWSXM0100E; multiple; replies; single; request TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When a single request is sent to a Mediation Flow Component in WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus, WebSphere Process Server, or Business Process Manager Advanced, services can be invoked more than once. 

SYMPTOM
The following error message can be observed in the SystemOut.log file:

CWSXM0100E: Multiple replies have been produced for a single request flow in module <module_name> 

More than one invocation can occur from a single request.

CAUSE
This error occurs when a mediation primitive is wired more than once to the next mediation primitive. It might seem to be a single wire. However, upon closer inspection, more than one wire exists. 


By mistake, primitives might be wired more than once when there is only one wire. See the following screen shot:
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21584783&amp;aid=1]

If you move the primitives in question, however, you notice that there are more wires underneath:

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21584783&amp;aid=2]



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To solve this problem, complete the following steps: 

 1. Delete any redundant wires. 
    
    
 2. Save the project.
    
    
 3. Redeploy the application to the server.

 IBM DOORS module fails to open in exclusive edit mode results in error "unable to open module ...no such file or directory" - United States missing session file; file not found; can not open module; open module exclusive edit fails; PM50525 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to open a module exclusive edit in IBM Rational DOORS result in the error "DOORS report
Unable to open module '/A Project/Requirements' No such file or directory". 

SYMPTOM
A module with a large number of sections is used mostly in shareable edit mode. 

You can open the module Read-only , or Shareable-Edit; but not in exclusive edit. 

Steps to reproduce: 

 1. Login to DOORS
    
    
 2. Click the Project, or folder, icon that contains the module
    
    
 3. Click the module icon in the DOORS Explorer window
    
    
 4. Click File > Open> Exclusive Edit (Ctrl + E)
    


Expected result: The module should open in Exclusive edit mode.  

Actual result: The module will not open in exclusive edit module; however it will open in read only mode, or shareable edit mode. If you attempt to check the database integrity for issue the module is not flagged for any problems. 

The full error message is as follows:

DOORS report
Unable to open module '/A Project/Requirements' No such file or directory"
C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\Rational\DOORS\9.5\data\v6data\20\m00000021.mod\current.ver\s1000005.dtc

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21511831&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21511831&aid=1]

CAUSE
 This issue has been identified as a product defect under APAR PM50525 [http://ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM31236].



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This error indicates that a user session file is corrupted on the database server. 

This defect is resolved in IBM Rational DOORS Version 9.4.0.1 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27036720#9401] 

 

WORKAROUND: 

the following options can be used to correct this problem: 

 * Retrieve the missing file from system backup and insert it into the module current.ver directory
   
   The advantage of inserting the missing session file is you do not need to restart the database server.

Warning these two option should only be performed by Rational Support. Modifications to the files in your DOORS database could result is data corruption and jeapordize your DOORS database. Send the session.ixc file to support for repair

From the module directory listed in the error message provide support the file session.ixc
Choosing to have support repair the session index file requires you to have all users log out 
and shut down the DOORS database server until the repaired file is returned and inserted 
to replace the existing data file for the module.

Create a replacement session file 
From the module directory listed in the error message provide support the file session.ixc
Adjacent session files will be required in order to to create the replacement. 
Your support engineer will identify these files from the session index file.
No work can be performed in the effected module until the replacement session file is restored
for the effected module.  


Note: Generally the repair is only required for one user session file. However in circumstances where DOORS reports a missing session file for a module- the event that caused this may have effected session files for other users connected to the module. For this situation you may need to perform a successive repair to the index file.

 * IBM WebSphere Lombardi Edition [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~WebSphere&product=ibm/WebSphere/WebSphere+Lombardi+Edition&release=All&platform=All&function=aparId&apars=JR50092]


If you are using earlier unsupported versions, IBM strongly recommends that you upgrade to a supported version. 

The fix introduces additional functionality to the product with two server-side configuration options. One option is for file uploads and other option is for file downloads. 
 * A server-side configuration option is introduced, which allows you to specify an optional white-list of MIME types. MIME types that are included in the list are allowed for uploads, but all other MIME types are blocked from uploads. 
 * A server-side configuration option is introduced, which allows you to specify an optional black-list of MIME type mappings. Each MIME type mapping allows for a conversion to be made from a specific MIME type to a specific MIME type upon download.


The following example is a sample configuration of new options, which you can configure in the 100Custom.xml file: 

<server> 
<!-- mime type white list which specifies mime types accepted for --> 
<!-- upload to document list or document attachment --> 
<document-attachment-accepted-mime-types> 
<!-- specifies whether to allow a null mime type for upload --> 
<allow-null-mime-type>false</allow-null-mime-type> 
<!-- lists the mime types allowed for upload --> 
<mime-type>text/plain</mime-type> 
<mime-type>img/png</mime-type> 
</document-attachment-accepted-mime-types> 

<!-- mime type black list which specifies mappings from unacceptable --> 
<!-- mime types to acceptable mime types for download from --> 
<!-- document list or document attachment --> 
<document-attachment-download-mime-types> 
<!-- will map text/html mime type to text/plain mime type --> 
<mime-type-map> 
<from>text/html</from> 
<to>text/plain</to> 
</mime-type-map> 
<!-- missing <to> element implies mapping to content/octet-stream --> 
<mime-type-map> 
<from>application/pdf</from> 
</mime-type-map> 
</document-attachment-download-mime-types> 
</server> 

Note: The default configuration, which does not include the configuration information that is provided in the 100Custom.xml file, acts as a blacklist for the text/html MIME type and maps it to the text/plain MIME type. Providing a configuration in the 100Custom.xml file overrides the default configuration. As a result, for text/html to remain on the blacklist, it should be explicitly added to the 100Custom.xml file. WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

CAUSE
Installation Manager is an Eclipse Rich Client Program application based on the open source project found at http://www.eclipse.org [http://www.eclipse.org]. Eclipse changed the window system requirement from motif to gtk on UNIX operating systems. For AIX, this Eclipse window system change requires the gtk libraries to be installed to support the GUI. For Installation Manager, the GUI is the wizard mode of operation. 

You can use Installation Manager without the gtk libraries. For information on console mode, command-line mode, or silent mode; see the Installation Manager Information Center [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/install/v1r6/topic/com.ibm.cic.agent.ui.doc/topics/c_modes.html]. Silent mode uses a response file and command-line mode is supported by all packages. For console mode, check your product documentation to verify that the product supports console mode.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To use the GUI, the gtk+ RPM and dependencies must be available on AIX. 


Install this set of RPMs on AIX:


atk-1.12.3-2.aix5.2.ppc.rpm
cairo-1.8.8-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm
expat-2.0.1-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm
fontconfig-2.4.2-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm
freetype2-2.3.9-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm
gettext-0.10.40-6.aix5.1.ppc.rpm
glib2-2.12.4-2.aix5.2.ppc.rpm
gtk2-2.10.6-4.aix5.2.ppc.rpm
libjpeg-6b-6.aix5.1.ppc.rpm
libpng-1.2.32-2.aix5.2.ppc.rpm
libtiff-3.8.2-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm
pango-1.14.5-4.aix5.2.ppc.rpm
pixman-0.12.0-3.aix5.2.ppc.rpm
xcursor-1.1.7-3.aix5.2.ppc.rpm
xft-2.1.6-5.aix5.1.ppc.rpm
xrender-0.9.1-3.aix5.2.ppc.rpm
zlib-1.2.3-3.aix5.1.ppc.rpm

The installed RPMs must be of the minimum versions listed above.

To install the RPM versions specified above take the following steps: 


 1. Download the gtk2_bundle_v2.tar package [ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/aix/freeSoftware/aixtoolbox/ezinstall/ppc/] (version 'v2') containing all the RPMs and the install script to a new directory. 
    
    
 2. Decompress the tar file. 
    You can use the command tar -xvf gtk2_bundle_<version>.tar to decompress the file.
    
    
 3. Open the decompressed directory gtk2_bundle_<version> and run the install.sh script.
    
    The script will check if the required RPMs are installed at the compatible level. If they are not, the script will prompt to install the compatible versions.
    
    
 4. Verify the environment variable LIBPATH contains a path to the installed libraries. 
    For example LIBPATH=/opt/freeware/lib/


Note that if you download and install RPMs individually, we have found that the following libraries are incompatible:  * glib2-2.14.6-2 and gtk2-2.10.6-5

 IBM Too Many Open Files error message - United States wasrun; wasjdk; open; files; too; ProblemDeterminationDocument; JCC was appserver app server TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote explains how to debug the "Too many open files" error message on Microsoft Windows, AIX, Linux and Solaris operating systems. 

SYMPTOM
The following messages could be displayed when the process has exhausted the file handle limit: 

java.io.IOException: Too many open files

[3/14/15 9:26:53:589 EDT] 14142136 prefs W Could not lock User prefs. Unix error code 24.

New sockets/file descriptors can not be opened after the limit has been reached. 


CAUSE
System configuration limitation.

When the "Too Many Open Files" error message is written to the logs, it indicates that all available file handles for the process have been used (this includes sockets as well). In a majority of cases, this is the result of file handles being leaked by some part of the application. This technote explains how to collect output that identifies what file handles are in use at the time of the error condition.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM




Determine Ulimits

On UNIX and Linux operating systems, the ulimit for the number of file handles can be configured, and it is usually set too low by default. Increasing this ulimit to 8000 is usually sufficient for normal runtime, but this depends on your applications and your file/socket usage. Additionally, file descriptor leaks can still occur even with a high value. 

Display the current soft limit:
ulimit -Sn

Display the current hard limit:
ulimit -Hn

Or capture a Javacore, the limit will be listed in that file under the name NOFILE:
kill -3 PID


Please see the following document if you would like more information on where you can edit ulimits:
Guidelines for setting ulimits (WebSphere Application Server)
http://www.IBM.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg21469413 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg21469413]


Operating Systems 

Windows By default, Windows does not ship with a tool to debug this type of problem. Instead Microsoft provides a tool that you can download called Process Explorer [http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653]. This tool identifies the open handles/files associated with the Java™ process (but usually not sockets opened by the Winsock component) and determines which handles are still opened. These handles result in the "Too many open files" error message. 

To display the handles, click on the Gear Icon [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21067352&amp;aid=1] in the toolbar (or press CTRL+ H to toggle the handles view). The icon will change to the icon for DLL files (so you can toggle it back to the DLL view). 

It is important that you change the Refresh Rate. Select View > Update Speed, and change it to 5 seconds. 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21067352&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21067352&aid=2] 

There is also another Microsoft utility called Handle that you can download from the following URL: 
https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896655.aspx [https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896655.aspx] 

This tool is a command line version of Process Explorer. The URL above contains the usage instructions. 


AIX 
The commands lsof and procfiles are usually the best commands to determine what files and sockets are opened.. 

lsof 
To determine if the number of open files is growing over a period of time, issue lsof to report the open files against a PID on a periodic basis. For example: 

lsof -p [PID] -r [interval in seconds, 1800 for 30 minutes] > lsof.out 

This output does not give the actual file names to which the handles are open. It provides only the name of the file system (directory) in which they are contained. The lsof command indicates if the open file is associated with an open socket or a file. When it references a file, it identifies the file system and the inode, not the file name. 

It is best to capture lsof several times to see the rate of growth in the file descriptors. 

procfiles 
The procfiles command does provide similar information, and also displays the full filenames loaded. It may not show sockets in use. 

procfiles -n [PID] > procfiles.out 


Other commands (to display filenames that are opened) 

INODES and DF 
df -kP filesystem_from_lsof | awk '{print $6}' | tail -1 
>> Note the filesystem name 
find filesystem_name -inum inode_from_lsof -print > filelist.out 
>> Shows the actual file name 

svmon 
svmon -P PID -m | grep pers (for JFS) 
svmon -P PID -m | grep clnt (for JFS2, NFS) 
(this opens files in the format: filesystem_device:inode) 

Use the same procedure as above for finding the actual file name. 


Linux To determine if the number of open files is growing over a period of time, issue lsof to report the open files against a PID on a periodic basis. For example: 

lsof -p [PID] -r [interval in seconds, 1800 for 30 minutes] > lsof.out 

The output will provide you with all of the open files for the specified PID. You will be able to determine which files are opened and which files are growing over time. 

It is best to capture lsof several times to see the rate of growth in the file descriptors. 


Alternately you can list the contents of the file descriptors as a list of symbolic links in the following directory, where you replace PID with the process ID. This is especially useful if you don't have access to the lsof command: 

ls -al /proc/PID/fd 


Solaris Run the following commands to monitor open file (socket) descriptors on Solaris: 

pfiles 
/usr/proc/bin/pfiles [ PID ] > pfiles.out 

lsof 
lsof -p [ PID ] > lsof.ou t 

This will get one round of lsof output. If you want to determine if the number of open files is growing over time, you can issue the command with the -r option to capture multiple intervals: 
lsof -p [PID] -r [interval in seconds, 1800 for 30 minutes] > lsof.out 

It is best to capture lsof several times to see the rate of growth in the file descriptors. 

HP-UX 
lsof 
lsof -p [ PID ] > lsof.out 

This will get one round of lsof output. If you want to determine if the number of open files is growing over time, you can issue the command with the -r option to capture multiple intervals: 
lsof -p [PID] -r [interval in seconds, 1800 for 30 minutes] > lsof.out 

It is best to capture lsof several times to see the rate of growth in the file descriptors.

 IBM How to make persistent the events for starting and stopping an MQ queue manager - United States  WHITE PAPER

ABSTRACT
 This techdoc provides all the necessary steps to help you monitor the queue SYSTEM.ADMIN.QMGR.EVENT to audit the start and the stop for a MQ queue manager. 

CONTENT
First, a baseline scenario is described in which when using the defaults, there is only 1 record in the SYSTEM.ADMIN.QMGR.EVENT queue, regardless of how many times you restart the queue manager.


Second, a modification is done to the SYSTEM.ADMIN.QMGR.EVENT queue to indicate that the default persistence is enabled, and thus, subsequent events from the stop/start of the queue manager will be kept in the queue.
alter ql(SYSTEM.ADMIN.QMGR.EVENT) defpsist(YES)

Caveat:
If you want to have persistent messages in the SYSTEM.ADMIN.QMGR.EVENT queue you will need to have discipline and a procedure to get and remove the messages, otherwise, the queue will eventually fill up.

 IBM When to enable Conversation Sharing in DataPower MQ Queue Manager (mq-qm) object - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When to enable Sharing Conversations in DataPower MQ Queue Manager (mq-qm) object along with SHARECNV attribute of the MQ SVRCONN channel? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
IBM WebSphere MQ server version 7.0 and later releases provide sharing conversations (SHARECNV) attribute on SVRCONN channel that specifies the maximum number of conversations that can share each TCP/IP channel instance. This feature can be configured in DataPower as it uses client connection with queue manager SVRCONN channel. 
The default setting of sharing conversations (SHARECNV) value is zero in DataPower mq-qm object. The same default value for MQ SVRCONN channel is 10. The sharing conversations value is 
negotiated between MQ server and DataPower and the lower value takes effect. However, in current versions of the DataPower firmware, the sharing conversations setting of 1 is treated as 0 when negotiating with MQ server.

There are three use cases to configure Sharing Conversations in DataPower mq-qm object: 

Case #1 : The negotiated sharing conversations value is 0 - The channel runs in a mode similar to WebSphere MQ V6 and does not uses features such as

· Administrator stop-quiesce
· Heartbeating 
· Read ahead 
· Client asynchronous consume

Set a value of 0 or 1 on the Sharing Conversations attribute of the mq-qm object in DataPower to disable sharing conversations regardless of the IBM WebSphere MQ SVRCONN setting.

Case #2: The negotiated sharing conversations value is 1 - The channel supports IBM WebSphere MQ V7 and later release features as outlined in case #1, but each TCP/IP channel instance has a single conversation.

Set a value of 1 on the Sharing Conversations attribute and select "on" in Share Single Conversation attribute of the mq-qm object in DataPower as shown in the following picture and a value of 1 on IBM WebSphere MQ SVRCONN setting.

The Share Single Conversation attribute is only visible when "Sharing Conversations" is configured with value of "1" and then <RETURN> key is entered. For values greater than 1, the "Share Single Conversation" attribute is hidden in the mq-qm object.
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21647231&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21647231&aid=1] 

Case #3: The negotiated sharing conversations value is 2 or more - The channel supports IBM WebSphere MQ 7 and later release features and each TCP/IP channel instance supports 2 or more conversations.

Set a value of 2 or more on the Sharing Conversations attribute of the mq-qm object in DataPower and on the MQ SVRCONN channel.

On average, processing of messages from client applications is 15 percent slower when using SHARECNV(10) as compared to SHARECNV(0). Please refer to Performance Implications of Sharing [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_7.0.1/com.ibm.mq.csqzaf.doc/mi12240_.htm]
Conversations on Client-connection Channels. [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_7.0.1/com.ibm.mq.csqzaf.doc/mi12240_.htm].

Since DataPower uses a connection pool in processing MQ messages, there are no additional benefits of using sharing conversations with the mq-qm object. However, in situations when mixed message sizes are used by the same mq-qm object, using case #2 will benefit mq-qm object as it will use new buffer management feature of IBM WebSphere MQ Version 7 when making MQGET API call.

When using a negotiated shared conversations value of 0 as in case #1, mq-qm object uses maximum message size as the buffer pool for the MQGET API call. However, when mixed message sizes are processed by the same MQ Front Side Handler (FSH), it requests buffer pool based on maximum message size configured in the mq-qm object. The use of fixed buffer pool for small and large messages can deplete MQ server's allocated buffer and contribute to unexpected termination of MQ SVRCONN channel instance and may terminate the queue manager. In such a situation, using a negotiated sharing conversations value of 1 as in case #2 will benefit DataPower mq-qm object as it will use IBM WebSphere MQ Version 7 Read Ahead feature and the new buffer management feature for MQGET API call. IBM WebSphere MQ V8 release provides enhanced performance for case #2, when the negotiated sharing conversations value is 1.

For DataPower firmware releases 7.0.0.x, 7.1.0.x, 7.2.0.x and earlier, one should follow case #1 and use a negotiated sharing conversations value of 0. If you configure these firmware versions with case #2 or case #3, DataPower device may reload or hang due to connection instability and generate many MQ errors with Reason Code - 2009 and 2059. 

Cases #2 and #3 can be used in firmware releases 7.5.0.x, 7.5.1.x and later. We suggest to use a value of 10 or less in Sharing Conversations attribute of the mq-qm object and verify the configuration empirically to make sure that IBM WebSphere MQ server can sustain load from DataPower with the negotiated Sharing Conversations of 10.

Note: In order to use sharing conversations, make sure you have applied APAR IV24821 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV24821] ("Client C application process hangs after cancelling thread") to the IBM WebSphere MQ server. IV24821 is included in IBM WebSphere MQ V7.0.1.10 and later, IBM WebSphere MQ V7.1.0.3 and later, IBM WebSphere MQ V7.5.0.1 and later, and IBM WebSphere MQ V8.

In order to identify the negotiated Sharing Conversations status, the following MQ commands are used in the distributed platform.

runmqsc <qmgr>
display chs(CHANNEL3) maxshcnv curshcnv

display chs(CHANNEL3) maxshcnv curshcnv
1 : display chs(CHANNEL3) maxshcnv curshcnv

 IBM MQ 8.0.0.4 FAILS TO INSTALL ON CERTAIN IBM PURE APPLICATION SYSTEM LEVELS - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Users observe errors when attempting to install or migrate to IBM MQ 8.0.0.4 using IBM Pure Application System. 

SYMPTOM
Users observe errors when attempting to install or migrate to IBM MQ 8.0.0.4 using the following levels of IBM Pure Application System: 

 * 2.1.2.0 
 * 2.2.0.0 and later



This affects users with IBM MQ Pure Application System pattern-types 1.0.0.2 and earlier. 
CAUSE
Because of an interface change in IBM Pure Application System 2.1.2.0, and in 2.2.0.0 and greater, installation and upgrade of IBM MQ at the latest maintenance level contained in the pattern-type fails. The installation appears to succeed, but IBM MQ 8.0.0.2 is installed and the subsequent fixpack update is not applied. This affects IBM MQ Pure Application System pattern-types 1.0.0.2 and earlier, leading to the following restrictions: 

 * For IBM Pure Application System releases earlier than 2.1.2.0 and at version 2.1.2.1, you can install all versions of IBM MQ contained in the pattern-type. You can also apply maintenance to running pattern instances. 
 * For IBM Pure Application System 2.1.2.0, 2.2.0.0 and later, you can install IBM MQ 8.0.0.2 only. You cannot install later versions e.g., 8.0.0.4. You cannot apply maintenance to running pattern instances.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
A new maintenance.py lifecycle script is available to enable installation and migration of the latest maintenance level of IBM MQ contained in the pattern-type. 


This update, and installation steps, can be obtained from IBM Fix Central:

 IBM Increasing size of heap memory allocated to Cast Iron Studio - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I increase the size of the heap memory allocated to the Cast Iron Studio? 

ANSWER
Start the Studio through the command line interface using the following command: 


CastIronStudio.exe -J-Xmx1024m 


In this command, "1024" is the new memory size that will be allocated to the Studio instead of the default value of 512. This numeric value is in MB. 

Note: There are no benchmark figures on the max value for a given machine configuration that is supported as max memory by Studio. Use garbage collection from Studio to free up unused space, Also, try XML Schema preference settings and see if the use of memory is within the default value of 520 MB or a permissible increased value.

For additional questions related to Increasing heap memory size, open a service request with IBM Cast Iron Support. More information about using the IBM Service Request tool is available here [http://www-01.ibm.com/software/support/servicerequest/quick_start.html].

 IBM Policy (EJQAB0067E) and JCR Login (WSP0005E) exceptions in System*.logs - United States EJQAB0067E; WSP0005E; LoginException; policy; theme; attribute; JCR TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
Policy (EJQAB0067E) and JCR Login (WSP0005E) exceptions occur in the System* logs when accessing Portal pages after user authentication.

SYMPTOM
SystemOut.log shows:

[datestamp] 00000241 PolicyService E com.ibm.wps.policy.services.PolicyService getPolicy Exception calling storage api: com.ibm.portal.WpsException: EJQAB0067E: An error occurred while getting the policy root.

[datestamp] 00000241 SystemErr R Caused by: com.ibm.icm.da.DBAccessException: User id can not be null
[datestamp] 00000241 SystemErr R at com.ibm.icm.da.portable.connection.Logon.logon(Logon.java:177)


CAUSE
Authenticated user does not have the attribute defined in the backend user registry which matches the attribute defined in the store.puma_default.user.fbadefault.filter property in WP PumaStoreService Resource Environment Provider. Such attribute is used by JCR when querying for theme policy information.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Collect the following: 

 * LDIF export of a sample user that hits this problem (if the backend user registry is LDAP)  * If you cannot determine a specific user causing the error, you can use the following tracestring to confirm:
   
   *=info:com.ibm.wps.policy.services.*=finest:com.ibm.wps.policy.commands.*=finest
   
   Then look for the following line in trace.log: com.ibm.wps.policy.services.PolicyService PolicyService() ENTRY userid contructor: {DN of user} 
   
   
 * Resources.xml - can be found under  * <wp_profile>/config/cells/<cellname>/clusters/<clustername>/ for cluster 
    * <wp_profile>/config/cells/<cellname>/nodes/<nodename>/servers/<portalservername>/ for standalone
   
   

Locate the WP PumaStoreService Resource Environment Provider in resources.xml and confirm if there is a defined property name for store.puma_default.user.fbadefault.filter. If not, then the default and active value for such property is "uid". If it does exist, then verify the attribute defined for the value. Then check the LDIF export for the user to confirm if such attribute is defined. 
RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Create/update the store.puma_default.user.fbadefault.filter custom property for the WP PumaStoreService Resource Environment Provider via the Integrated Solutions Console to an attribute that exists for all Portal users in the backend user registry (for example, "cn").

 IBM Hide left menu pane for specific application - United States TPAESCCD; menu; navigation; hide; disabled; systemnav TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How to disable the left navigation pane menu of an application? 

ANSWER
You can include systemnav="false" in the application presentation XML in order to disable the left navigation pane. 

The following changes in the incident.xml file will disable the left navigation menu pane of the Incident application. 

Edit the incident.xml from :- 

<presentation apphelp="com.ibm.tusc.doc,incident/incident.html" beanclass="com.ibm.tsd.pminc.webclient.beans.PmIncidentAppBean" id="incident" mboname="INCIDENT" orderby="TICKETID" resultstableid="results_showlist" version="7.1.0.0">

Import back the incident.xml and save. With this configuration, the left Navigation Pane menu is no longer visible in the Incident application. 

 IBM Java.io.NotSerializableException thrown when persistent sessions or PMI is enabled - United States serializable; NotSerializableException; java.io.NotSerializableException; waseng; session; httpsession; httpsessions; persistent; ProblemDeterminationTool; ProblemDeterminationDocument TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When Persistent sessions or PMI is enabled and a Java.io.NotSerializableException occur in logs, you will see the following example error message. 


[10/4/02 10:11:10:172 EDT] 28b7c18b SessionContex X WTRN0047E:
java.io.NotSerializableException: COM.ibm.db2.jdbc.app.DB2Connection



CAUSE
The class name at the end of the exception is the object that does not implement the java.io.Serializable or java.io.Externalizable interface. In most instances, this object is the attribute that was put into the session object; however, sometimes this object is referenced by an attribute of the session object. 

 To determine which attribute of the session object references this non-serializable object, access the SessionInspectServlet.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Implement the Java.io.Serializable or Java.io.Externalizable interface

With persistent sessions enabled, any object that is put into the HTTPSession must implement the serializable interface in order for session manager to store the session data outside of JVM.

When PMI is enabled, there is a counter for session data size. In order to evaluate this counter, the session data must be serialized into a byte array stream. Any object that is put into the HTTPSession must implement the serializable interface in order for session manager to convert the session data objects into byte array stream.

For example:

public classMyObject implementsSerializable{
}//end of class MyObject

Check that all objects placed in the HTTPSession implement the java.io.Serializable or java.io.Externalizable interface.


 1. Acess the SessionInspectServlet
    
    If the class name printed in the exception is not an object that is explicitly placed into the HTTPSession, use the SessionInspectServlet to determine the attribute in the HTTPSession that references a non-serializable object. 



SessionInspectServlet helps application writers to determine if application is written to support session persistence. SessionInspectServlet helps to: 

 * Determine attributes present in the session
   
 * Determine serializable and non-serializable attributes in the session
   
 * Determine the size of each serializable attribute in session
   
 * Determine if serializable attribute is implemented properly (if serializable attribute and all its internals are serializable)


Servlet serializes and deserializes attributes into memory to simulate session persistence; therefore, application writers need not turn on session persistence to run this servlet. However, you can run it with persistent sessions enabled. 

How to Access the SessionInspectServlet: 
 1. com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.httpsession.SessionInspectServlet is shipped with WebSphere Application Server. It is already in the classpath and does not need to be added to the application. 
    
    Define a servlet/uri entry for class SessionInspectServlet. If ServeServletsByClassnameEnabled is set to true (check the ibm-web-ext.xmi file in the WEB-INF directory of your webModule) in your webModule, servlet/uri definition is not needed. 
    
 2. Restart your Web module.
    
 3. Open a browser and access your Web module from the browser, then navigate the application in the browser to populate the session.
    
 4. Press Crtl+N to open a new browser, then access the SessionInspectServlet in the new browser by calling the URI that you defined in step 2. If you are using ServeServletsbyClassname, the URI will be "webapp_context_root\servlet\com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.httpsession.SessionInspectServlet". This displays the session details at that moment. You can access the servlet as you navigate your application to determine the session contents as you go along. Note: The servlet does not support attributes in the session that are outside the WebSphere Application Server scope. That is, session contents need to be accessed by the server class loader scope.

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Installation of TCR 2.1.1 FixPack 2 fails with the following error message:
ACUOSI0050E External command action failed with return code 1. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Looking at the the file IBM_Tivoli_Common_Reporting_2.1_1_FP2.log you can find additional details about the failure.
In some cases it can show the procedure failing at this step:

Errors: [com.ibm.ac.si.ap.action.ExternalCommandActionException:

 IBM A new IBM Support Assistant data collector exists in the IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Version 8.5 products - United States ISA data collection datacollection logs bpmdc isadc NEWS

ABSTRACT
 The new data collector in IBM Business Process Manager V8.5 is designed for ease of use to gather some of the standard information that is needed to debug IBM Business Process Manager issues. This command-line tool can gather log file or configuration information and upload it to a Problem Management Record (PMR). This collector is also included in IBM Business Process Manager V8.0.1 Fix Pack 3. 

CONTENT
The script gathers various product information, compresses it into a .zip file, and can optionally send the compressed file to IBM for a PMR. You can also use this tool to compress the data without sending it to IBM. The command is profile_root/bin/bpmdc
The profile_root variable is the base profile directory for the profile from which you want to get data. 

Common Examples 

To gather the logs and upload them to ECURep: 
C:/MyProfileDirectory/bin/bpmdc -PMR=12345.678.901 -uploadToIBM=yes 

To gather the logs and config directory: 

C:/MyProfileDirectory/bin/bpmdc -PMR=12345.678.901 -uploadToIBM=yes -config=yes 

To gather logs for installation issues: 

C:/MyProfileDirectory/bin/bpmdc -PMR=12345.678.901 -uploadToIBM=yes -type=Install 

To gather 3 java cores from MyAppServer at 60 second intervals: 

C:/MyProfileDirectory/bin/bpmdc -PMR=12345.678.901 -uploadToIBM=yes -type=Dump -server=MyAppServer -soapport=8881 -user=admin -password=admin -dumptype=Thread -count=3 -interval=60 





Command Line Parameter Default Value Description PMR None This parameter is the 11-digit PMR number to which the data is associated. Use one of the following forms for this value: 12345.678.901 or "12345,678,901"
Note: Comma characters can be an issue on the Microsoft Windows command-line if you do not surround the value with the double quote characters. uploadToIBM no This parameter specifies whether to upload the data to the IBM ECURep site for a particular PMR. You can set this value to yes or no. outputDirectory install_root/BPM/isadc This parameter specifies the path to the directory where the output collection .zip file will be stored. type General This parameter specifies which type of collection to run. The valid values are General, Install, or Dump(8.5.5). config no With a general collection, when you set this parameter to yes, the config directory is included. You can set this value to yes or no. help No values When you include this parameter with the command, a description of the command options is displayed. Server Connection options added in 8.5.5 
Required for -type=Dump server No default This option specifies the server from which you wish to collect JVM dumps. soapport No default This option specifies the SOAP port for the server. user No default This option specifies the user with wsadmin access to the server to which you are connecting. password No default This option specifies the password for the user. Dump options added in 8.5.5 
Available for -type=Dump dumptype Thread This option specifies the type of Java™ virtual machine (JVM) dump to trigger: 
Thread - Javacore or thread dump. 
Heap - A Heap dump is generated.
System - System dump is also generated and has JExtract run on it. count 1 This option specifies the number of JVM dumps to trigger during the collection. interval 0 This option specifies the interval in seconds to wait between JVM dumps. 

You can run the command without any parameters, which results in the general collection being run and the logs directory is compressed into a .zip file. 


The output file name has the following format: PMRnumber . type _ timeStampValue .zip
In V8.5.5 the format is changed to: PMRnumber . ProfileName_type _ timeStampValue .zip 


The data gathered is based on the profile where the command is run. If it is run from the installation directory, then the default profile is used. 


Note: Be sure to run the command from the profile from which you wish to gather data. 


General collection 
The "General" collection gathers the following information:  * Profile logs directory (profile_root/logs). The collected files include all of the server log files and trace under this profile directory. 
 * The results of the versionInfo-maintenancePackages command. 
 * (Optionally) The profile config directory (profile_root/config). This directory is only collected when the -config=yes option is used.


Note: The limitation with this collection is that it does not gather log files and trace if it goes to a custom directory outside of the Profile logs directory. It is not recommended that you change the log file locations from the default as it makes it more difficult for other people to find them. 

Install collection
The "Install" collection gathers the following information that is listed in the Collect troubleshooting data for installation or upgrade problems with IBM Business Process Manager products [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21506937] document: 

 * Any temporary launchpad log files. 
 * Installation Manager Data directory 
 * The results of the versionInfo -maintenancePackages command 
 * Installation logs directory 
 * Profile logs directory 
 * Database upgrade script log files 
 * Various configuration files that are related to the installation process




JVM Dump collection The "Dump" collection type triggers various JVM dumps on a target server within a profile prior to gathering the general collection and generated dumps. 

With the provided server connection options, the command will connect to the server using the soapport to make a wsadmin connection with the user and password. Depending on the dump type, it will trigger various JVM dumps until the count amount is reached. The dumps are triggered a set number of seconds apart based on the interval that is set. 

The collection will gather the general collection files like /logs and version information in addition to the dump files like Javacores, heap dumps and system dump .zip files. 

 * Thread - This type will trigger Javacores or thread dumps to be produced for the JVM. 
 * Heap - This type will trigger heap dumps to be generated. 
 * System - This type will trigger system dumps to be generated. It will also run JExtract on the dump prior to the upload, which can take some time depending on the heap size. 



Common usage The following list provides some common usage scenarios for this command: 

 * After an issue occurs, use the basic bpmdc command to compress the log files for the profile into a .zip file. 
 * Recreate your issue after setting a trace string using the administrative console [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/info/ae/ae/ttrb_entrrs.html] or wsadmin [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/info/ae/ae/txml_troubleshooting.html]. 
   Then, run the bpmdc command to collect the log files and send them to IBM. 
 * After opening a PMR, use bpmdc-PMR=PMRnumber-uploadToIBM=yes with the most relevant type options to upload data. 
 * IBM Support provides a specific command or set of commands to run for your environment that gets the needed data. 
 * IBM Support provides a traces string that needs to be gathered with the commands. With trace enabled, you recreate the issue or wait for a reoccurrence before running the provided commands to gather and upload the data to IBM.

 IBM Prerequisites for IBM Content Collector Version 4.0.1 - United States  PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION

ABSTRACT
 This document details the system requirements for IBM Content Collector Version 4.0.1. 

CONTENT
 

Always up-to-date system requirement reports can be dynamically generated by using the Software Product Compatibility Reports (SPCR) tool [http://www-969.ibm.com/software/reports/compatibility/clarity/index.html]. 

From the Content Collector product tabs below you can select detailed system requirement reports for different contexts (by Operating System, by component). Note that clicking a link will always generate a new, up-to-date report.

Important:
Because other products frequently ship fixes, updates, and new releases, testing every configuration is not possible. In general, you can install and run with updates to supported products if those updates are forward compatible.

Always check for the latest IBM Content Collector security bulletins in the IBM Support Portal and make sure to have the required fixes applied.

WEB SERVER APPLICATIONS
IBM WEBSPHERE APPLICATION SERVER
IBM Content Collector requires IBM WebSphere Application Server to run the Configuration Web Service and to perform search and restore operations. Typically, there is no need to check for compatible versions because IBM Content Collector comes with an embedded version of WebSphere Application Server Version 8.0.

However, you can deploy some of the IBM Content Collector web applications to an external web application server. IBM Content Collector supports the base edition of IBM WebSphere Application Server for AIX, Linux, and Windows. The Network Deployment edition is not supported. Always install the latest fix pack. The following versions are supported: 

 * 8.0.0.13 
 * 8.5

If you use an external web application server, make sure that the following prerequisites that are required for IBM Content Collector Server are also installed on the separate web application server: 

 * Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Service Pack 1 Redistributable Package 
 * Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Service Pack 1 Redistributable Package ATL Security Update 
 * Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Service Pack 1 Redistributable Package

 IBM RDz TSO EXIT IKJEESX0 TERMINATES with RC04 - United States IKJEESX0 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM Rational Developer for z Systems (RDz) using TSO Send command may result in the error IKJ79154I for TSO EXIT IKJEESX0, RC 04


SYMPTOM
Issuing the TSO SEND command in a batch job may terminate with this message: 

IKJ79154I INSTALLATION EXIT IKJEESX0 REQUESTED TERMINATION. 
IKJ79154I REASON CODE X'00000004'. 


CAUSE
The RDz TSO Send command will invoke a TSO exit, IKJEESX0 (FEKEESX0) that will terminate with a reason code of 4 if you have not coded a facility class for the FEK.CMD.SEND and FEK.CMD.SEND.CLEAR.

The exit provided by RDz checks to see if the user has the authority to issue the TSO Send command by executing the RACROUTE macro:


RACROUTE REQUEST=AUTH,CLASS=(R5),ENTITYX=(rEntityBL), *
WORKA=(R0),RELEASE=2.2,ATTR=READ,LOG=NOSTAT, *
MF=(E,AUTHCHK) 




RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Code the appropriate security definitions for FEK.CMD.SEND and FEK.CMD.SEND.CLEAR. 

Below is an example from the Knowledge Center > Configuring > Host Configuration Guide that will allow everyone to send messages, and only users able to issue operator commands to clear the message buffer: 

 


RDEFINE FACILITY (FEK.CMD.SEND.**) UACC(READ) -
DATA('z/OS EXPLORER - SEND COMMAND') 


RDEFINE FACILITY (FEK.CMD.SEND.CLEAR.**) UACC(NONE) -
DATA('z/OS EXPLORER - CLEAR SEND BUFFER') 


PERMIT FEK.CMD.SEND.CLEAR.** CLASS(FACILITY) -
ID(STCRSE) ACCESS(READ)

 IBM ITCAM for SOA KD4SDMS database size grows - United States CAMSOAALL CAMSOADB CAMSOAPERF REQMETRICS RESPMETRICS kd4TrimDB2db TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 As the KD4SDMS grows unbounded, is there a way to regularly prune it? 

ANSWER
Regarding the older release ITCAM for SOA 7.1.1, there is no a mechanism to automatically regularly prune the KD4SDMS database. The following Wiki page has been published on the topic:
https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/Tivoli+Composite+Application+Manager/page/Pruning+SDMS+Relationship+Metrics+Tables [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/Tivoli+Composite+Application+Manager/page/Pruning+SDMS+Relationship+Metrics+Tables]

To keep only the latest 24 hours every day (regular pruning), you can schedule a daily job to run the kd4TrimDB2db utility provided above. 

As for the newer ITCAM for SOA 7.2, there is a cleanup task that runs on the TEPS host where SDMS database is installed. It deletes REQMETRICS and RESPMETRICS table rows where SRTTIME (start of period) is more than 24 hours ago. So these two tables, which are responsible for most of KD4SDMS storage occupation, should not grow unbounded anymore.

NOTE: ITCAM for SOA 7.1.1 is Out-Of-Support since 2015 April 30. 

 IBM How to enable Baselining in your monitored application. - United States tema enable baselining Unknown application health status CAMADALL CAMADINST TECHNOTE (FAQ)

THIS DOCUMENT APPLIES ONLY TO THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGE VERSION(S):
 US English 

QUESTION
 Steps to enable Baselining in your monitored application. 

ANSWER
The health of the monitored application is calculated against an internally stored baseline threshold. The baselining of the application is a process that uses a pre-defined mathematical and statistical method to automatically calculate a threshold based on response time information typically collected over a period of time (few days to few weeks.) 

By default baselining gets enabled with a situation WasAppDiscoverd. This situation is enabled by default and will discover new applications then run a take action to start the baselining. So if this situation is not enabled then you should enable it and assign to the ITCAM App Server managing system list. 

You want to do baselining with normal or typical load on the server over a period of few days to few weeks, or even few months. The performance of the application under this load is considered good (you will see "Good"" in the Application Health views) and deviation from this performance indicates degrading health ("Bad" or "Fair" in the Application Health views) of the monitored application. 

To start baselining for your application server, please follow these steps: 

(Note 1: in this example, I've used a WebSphere-based application but you can also do the same for any application on your J2EE agent also.) 

(Note 2: Before beginning baselining, make sure you have typical or normal load on the server to set the baselining threshold values.) 

1. Login to your TEPS, select Application Health, right-click on it, go to Workspace and select Application Registry. Look at the panels on the right and observe the baselining columns. If they're blank, your baselining has not been started. 

2. Next select Application Health, right-click on it, go to Workspace and select Application Health status. If you see Unknown, then you know the baselining has not started or not been calculated. 

3. High-lite your application, select the small yellow chain link in the first unnamed column and select Application Configuration Details. See screenshot here: 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21653905&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21653905&aid=1] 

4. In the bottom panel on the right select the line that says All and high-lite it. Then right-click it, select Take Action and Select. In the pull-down, select Start_Baselining and enter the Period (2 days), Update_Interval (every 2 hours), and Run_Clean set to 1 (clean start.) If you wish, you can change these values to whatever you want. 

See screenshots here:
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21653905&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21653905&aid=2]
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21653905&amp;aid=3]
Hit OK twice and you should get a Command completed successfully message. (Note: If you get a Baselining_Already_Active message in the pop-up window, then you should do another Take Action and Stop_Baselining first if you want to do the baselining again.)

Once you have the baselining active, let it run for the period of time with typical load on the server. After the baselining is complete, the Unknown values in the Application Health should now change to Good or Fair or Bad depending on threshold values.

 IBM Wrong codepoints for non-ASCII characters inserted in UTF-8 database using CLP - United States CLP; insert; codepage; unicode; wrong codepoints; CharConversionException TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 During insert from the CLP there is no codepage conversion if operating system codepage and database codepage are both UTF-8. In this case data to be inserted should also be in UTF-8 encoding.

If data has a different encoding then the database codepage (this can be verified using any hex editor), then the operating system codepage should be changed to match the data's encoding in order to enforce the data conversion to the database codepage. 

SYMPTOM
Error executing Select SQL statement. Caught by java.io.CharConversionException. ERRORCODE=-4220 

 Caused by: 
java.nio.charset.MalformedInputException: Input length = 4759 
at com.ibm.db2.jcc.b.u.a(u.java:19) 
at com.ibm.db2.jcc.b.bc.a(bc.java:1762) 


CAUSE
During an insert of data using CLP characters, they do not go through codepage conversion.
If operating system and database codepage both are UTF-8, but the data to be inserted is not Unicode, then data in the database might have incorrect codepoints (not-Unicode) and the above error will be a result during data retrieval. 

To verify the encoding for data to be inserted you can use any editor that shows hex representation of characters. Please verify the codepoints for non-ASCII characters that you try to insert. If you see only 1 byte per non-ASCII characters then you need to force the database conversion during insert from CLP to UTF-8 database. 

To force codepage conversion during insert from the CLP make sure that the operating system codepage is non-Unicode and matching to the codepage of data when you insert data to Unicode database from non-Unicode data source. 

Problem Details
An example problem scenario is as follows:


 1.  Create a database of type UTF-8:
     
     CREATE DATABASE <db> USING CODESET utf-8 TERRITORY US 
     
     
 2.  Create a table that holds character data:
     
     CREATE TABLE test (col char(20)) 
     
     
 3.  Check operating system locale:
     
     locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8 
     LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8" 
     
     
 4.  Insert the non-ASCII characters 'Ã' , '³', '©' which have codepoint 0x'C3', 0x'B3',0x'A9' in codepage 819 into the table:
     
     INSERT INTO test VALUES ('Ã')
     INSERT INTO test VALUES ('³')
     INSERT INTO test VALUES ('©') 
     
     
 5.  By running the following statement, you can see that all INSERT statements caused only one byte to be inserted into the table:
     
     SELECT col, HEX(col) FROM test
     
     
     Ã C3
     ³ B3
     © A9
     
     However, the UTF-8 representation of those characters are: 0x'C383' for 'Ã', 0x'C2B3' for '³', and 0x'C2A9' for '©'.
     So these three rows in the table contain invalid characters in UTF-8. 
     
     
 6.  When selecting from a column using the JDBC application, the following error will occur. This is expected because the table contains invalid UTF-8 data:
     Error executing Select SQL statement. Caught by java.io.CharConversionException. ERRORCODE=-4220
     Caused by:
     java.nio.charset.MalformedInputException: Input length = 4759
     at com.ibm.db2.jcc.b.u.a(u.java:19)
     at com.ibm.db2.jcc.b.bc.a(bc.java:1762) 
     
     
     
 7.  Delete all rows with incorrect Unicode codepoints from the test table:
     DELETE * from test 
     
     
 8.  Change the locale to one that matching codepage of data to be inserted:
     export locale=en_us. One of the way to determine the codepage for your data can be found here: http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/17201/Detect-Encoding-for-In-and-Outgoing-Text [http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/17201/Detect-Encoding-for-In-and-Outgoing-Text]. If you prepare data yourself using some editor please check the documentation for your editor to find out how to set up the codepage for data being prepared by the editor. 
     
     
 9.  Insert data to the table:
     INSERT INTO test VALUES ('Ã')
     INSERT INTO test VALUES ('³')
     INSERT INTO test VALUES ('©') 
     
     
 10. Verify that inserted data were converted to UTF-8 during insert:
     SELECT col, HEX(col) FROM test
     
     
     Ã C383
     ³ C2B3
     © C2A9 
     
     
 11. Run your java application selecting Unicode data. No exception should be reported. 




ENVIRONMENT
UNIX, Linux, Unicode database



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Verify that non-ASCII data have a proper Unicode codepoints in Unicode database



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Reinsert data with codepage conversion enforced by setting the operation system codepage matching to the codepage of data to be inserted

 IBM Health Checks and Introduction to Troubleshooting on a PureApplication System - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This document describes how to check the health of your system, and when needed, where to start troubleshooting a problem on a PureApplication System. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use this document to confirm the health of your system. 

Consider forwarding the PureApplication System Events to an external monitoring system, such as IBM Netcool/OMIbus. and enabling the call home feature. 

 

With PureApplication System firmware versions 2.1.0.1 or newer you can use the System Health check report to see a consolidated view of some of the PureApplication System UI pages. 

System > System Troubleshooting, click on System Health Check. 
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21675742&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21675742&aid=1] 

The Lite Health Checks section lists a set of items which you can review every couple of days. These checks take about 15 minutes. 

Full Health Checks lists a set items you can review every week to help you confirm your system is operational. There are more checks in this section. 

Introduction to Troubleshooting and Contacting IBM Support and sending in your information are included to help when the information found during a health check is not as expected. 

The checks include accessing information on both the System and Workload console. You will need System and Workload administration access. 



LITE HEALTH CHECKS 
Along with forwarding the events to a monitoring system, you might want to check the following items every couple of days. This should take about 15 minutes. 

If the information displayed is not as expected, expand all sections of the web page and copy the page to a word processing document. Proceed to the Contacting IBM Support and sending in your information section of this document. Start with Step 1 where you will add this information from a word processing document. 

 

 

Check Web Console Page Description High Availability Status of the system System Console > Troubleshooting, then expand the High Availability section. Under Service Code, the overall status should be "Online"when this feature is working properly. Problems System Console > System > Problems This view should be empty. However, if problems have been identified by the system, they will be listed here. 

You can sort problems by any of the column headers. The "Created on" date is usually the most helpful. Investigate any problems that are reported here. When the issue has been resolved or determined to not be a real problem, delete the records. 

Problems are not automatically deleted from this view. It is important to delete problems on resolution. Problems are often (but not always) associated with Events. There may be some overlap between information in this view and that presented in the Event Viewer.
Search the Support Portal [http://www.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/product/puresystems/pureapplication_system]for content that may help you avoid opening a service request. Events System Console > System > Events Events which have been identified by the system will be listed here. You can sort Events by any of the column headers but the "Updated on" and "Severity" are usually the most helpful. Some of the events are from problems experienced by the workload users and are critical to that workload but not to the entire system. Look for "critical" and "Call HOME events" 
Search the Support Portal [http://www.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/product/puresystems/pureapplication_system]for content that may help you avoid opening a service request.

Compute Nodes System Console > Hardware > Compute Nodes Click on any Errors or Warning Events and review the "Health statistic" and other information on these pages. 

Check that none of the nodes are in quiesced or stopped state. Click on each compute node in the system. Look for the word "Temperature". There are 2 values. Ambient Temperature and Maximum Ambient Temperature. Hover over the 'temperature icons' for these field to see the expected temperature range. 


On the W1700, a compute node with an LED on might be an indication of a AIX Operation System problem on one if the Virtual Machines which is or was running. See: Node <node_nn> message: (System Event) system hardware failure, CMM Event: 77777703, Node Event: B200A101, Check log (Informational LED) is lit on compute node. [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21669085] This is not a hardware problem



Management Nodes System Console > Hardware > Management Nodes Look at the status of elements and events associated with the two PureSystems Manager nodes and the other two. 

Click on any Errors or Warning Events and review the "Health statistic" and other information on these pages. 

One of the PureSystem Managers should be marked as the leader with the word "Primary" in the "Type" field. 

Any errors that are listed for management nodes can indicate significant problems. Job Queue System Console > System > Job Queue. You want to ensure that jobs are starting and finishing on this page. 

Check the Started Queue for failures. 

Click the check-box to show internal jobs to get a complete picture of the job queue. 

It is quickest to sort by "Status" which will pull all failures to the top. Failures of individual deployment jobs should be reviewed with the team managing the system workload. Scan the information to look for pervasive system issues here. Failed Deployments Workload Console > Instances > All Instances Look over the list of all instances to find those that are failed that appear to be stuck initializing. 

A large number of deployments in these failed or stalled states can indicate system wide problems that should be investigated. A few failed or error deployments will occasionally be there because of the way that these systems are being used by the team managing the work loads. Confirm all is well with the team working on these projects. 

Scan the information to look for pervasive system issues here. FULL HEALTH CHECKS 


Along with forwarding the events to a monitoring system, you might want to check the following items every week. The "Lite Health Check" are included in the "Full Health Check" list below.

 1.  The first action is to open up a word processing document to capture the output of any the following steps which shows the problem. Use this technote entitled Organize your problem information [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21654210] concerning the problem for IBM Support. Copy this template into your word processing document. 
 2.  Check System Console > System > Problems This view should be empty.  1. However, if problems have been identified by the system, they will be listed here. You can sort problems by any of the column headers but the 
         "Created on" is usually the most helpful. Investigate any problems that are reported here and when the issue has been resolved or determined to not be a real problem, delete the record. 
      2. Problems are not automatically deleted from this view. It is important to delete entries on resolution. Problems are often (but not always) associated with Events. There may be some overlap between information in this view and that presented in the Event Viewer. 
      3. Search the support portal [http://www.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/product/puresystems/pureapplication_system] [http://www.ibm.com/]to see if there is an explanation of the message in the product documentation center, a technote, or APAR document. 
      4. Otherwise, if you have problem listed which you would like IBM to investigate, export the problem. Add this to the document created with the organize your problem information [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21654210] technote. Check the MustGather Read first for PureApplication System [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21610259] for information to gather. Proceed to the Contacting IBM Support and sending in your information section of this document. 
     
     
 3.  Check the event log: System Console > System > Events  1. If Events have been identified by the system, they will be listed here. You can sort Events by any of the column headers but the "Updated on" and "Severity" are usually the most helpful. Investigate any problems. 
      2. Some of the Events are from problems experienced by the workload users and are critical to that workload but not to the entire system. Check with the workload users to see if they are testing or also finding problems. 
      3. Search the support portal [http://www.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/product/puresystems/pureapplication_system] to see [http://www.ibm.com/] if there is an explanation of the message in the product documentation, a technote, or APAR document. 
      4. Check if the Event lists a hardware component and a hardware error. Look for the failing serial number, name or rack location number.  1. This document has a list of Events which you might see. Look under "Check these known problems first" in this technote. MustGather: Chassis Management Module, IBM Storwize V7000, Top of Rack Switch, San Switch, and Management EndPoint problems for IBM PureApplication System [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21666454] [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21666454] 
          2. Check the status of the hardware component via: System Console > Hardware > Infrastructure Map.Try the "Switch to Tree View" option. 
          3. If the symptoms describe an Event which requires investigation by IBM, save a copy of the information and gather the information listed in MustGather: Chassis Management Module, IBM Storwize V7000, Top of Rack Switch, San Switch, and Management EndPoint problems for IBM PureApplication System [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21666454] [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21666454]
         
         
      5. Otherwise, if you find an Event which you would like IBM to investigate, save the Event. You can export the one event. Use the organize your problem information [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21654210] technote to prepare to work with IBM Support. Check the MustGather Read first for PureApplication System [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21610259] for information to gather. Proceed to the Contacting IBM Support and sending in your information section of this document. 
     
     
 4.  Check the job queue: System Console > System >Job Queue  1. Under "Started Jobs Queue", check that jobs are running. If not, check the "Display Internal Jobs" check box. Refresh the screen using the "double arrows' under the "Started Jobs Queue" line. Confirm that there were internal jobs running, and successfully completing. Wait 10 minutes. If there are no internal jobs running or completing, save a capture of this screen. Then obtain a system collection set for IBM Support.

DEFINITIONS
Regression: An error in the Maintenance Delivery Vehicle [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27008656] (MDV) that produces incorrect or unexpected behavior causing a supported feature to stop functioning as designed. 
This includes: 

 * Coding errors that cause a regression
 * Documentation or packaging problems that cause a regression
 * Errors reported in a new function delivered in a MDV that cause a regression

Incomplete: An error in the MDV has not regressed, but does not work as designed. 
This includes: 

 * Fixed APARs which did not solve the original problem but did not break anything new
 * APARs reporting documentation errors, such as readme errors, that cause problems applying an MDV but do not lead to a regression




Notes:  * Regression and incomplete APARs are considered fix-in-error or MDV-in-error
 * Definitions above apply only to valid APARs that result in product fixes (APARs returned as working-as-designed are not assessed for being fix-in-error)
 * Issues in major releases due to new functionality do not apply in this definition

APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The On Demand Router (ODR) has a memory leak related to
   HttpRouteAction objects such that when the system is under load
   and there are configuration changes such as uninstalling and
   installing applications it is possible that multiple, redundant
   HttpRouteAction objects can be created with registered
   listeners for ODC tree changes but never removed.  This will
   eventually fill up the available heap space and cause an Out Of
   Memory issue on the ODR.  Restarting the ODR will correct the
   problem.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Restart the ODR.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  All users of IBM WebSphere Application      *
   *                  Server Intelligent Management using the     *
   *                  java On Demand Router (ODR).                *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: An Out Of Memory error can be seen on   *
   *                      the On Demand Router because            *
   *                      HttpRouteAction objects can             *
   *                      accumulate.                             *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   There is a code bug where HttpRouteAction objects can
   accumulate because they are not freed. This is particularly
   noticeable when there are routing rules present, many
   applications installed, and multiple configuration changes
   happening on the system (such as installing or removing
   applications). Over time this can cause exhaustion of the
   available heap and an Out Of Memory error for the On Demand
   Router.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The area of code was corrected to release the HttpRouteAction
   objects. This fix supercedes PI51978 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI51978].
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   fix pack 8.5.5.9.  Please refer to the Recommended Updates
   page for delivery information:

 IBM Including long descriptions in the Maximo Enterprise Adapter - United States long description; ldkey; hasld; MEA; TPAEINTEGRATION TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I include long descriptions when sending data in using the Maximo Enterprise Adapter (MEA) or Maximo Integration Framework (MIF)? 

ANSWER
 

Maximo 6.x MEA 

1. Go To Integration -> Integration Object 

On the Persistent Fields tab, exclude HASLD
On the Non-Persistent Fields tab, include DESCRIPTION_LONGDESCRIPTION 

Maximo 7.x MIF

1. Go To Integration -> Object Structures 

Click Select Action -> Exclude/Include Fields 

On the Persistent Fields tab, exclude HASLD
On the Non-Persistent Fields tab, include DESCRIPTION_LONGDESCRIPTION 

Maximo 6.x/7.x XML

Add the long description tag to the inbound XML:

<DESCRIPTION_LONGDESCRIPTION>xxxxx</DESCRIPTION_LONGDESCRIPTION> 

Do not include the HASLD tag. This column will be set automatically.

The same process will work for sending data in using flat files and interface tables, however, you must use an alias for DESCRIPTION_LONGDESCRIPTION on DB2 and SQL Server since the column name is longer than 18. If your object structure has multiple MBOs with long descriptions, you will have to use an alias to identify each column name uniquely.

 IBM CWWIM1011E during PUMA lookup using SAML Trust Association Interceptor - United States SAML; SSO; TAI; PUMA; CWWIM1011E; InvalidUniqueNameException TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
After configuring the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) SAML Trust Association Interceptor (TAI) in WebSphere Application Server, you attempt to access WebSphere Portal after authenticating to your Identity Provider (IdP), but you are unable to view the Portal page.

SYMPTOM
- Portal page is blank 

- SystemOut.log contains the following error at the time of the problem occurrence:

com.ibm.websphere.wim.exception.InvalidUniqueNameException: CWWIM1011E
The '<userId>' unique name is not valid.


CAUSE
SAML TAI parameter sso_<n>.sp.idMap = is configured to use "idAssertion" which results in the userid instead of the fully distinguished name of the user to be set in the JAAS subject. Portal then uses this value to query Virtual Member Manager (VMM) via findUserByIdentifier() and the failure occurs since the value is not formatted as a distinguished name.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
- Collect Portal Login troubleshooting data [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21592791] 

- Look for the following in security.xml:
<interceptors xmi:id="TAInterceptor_<identifier>" interceptorClassName="com.ibm.ws.security.web.saml.ACSTrustAssociationInterceptor">
...
<trustProperties xmi:id="Property_<identifier>" name="sso_1.sp.idMap" value="idAssertion"/> 

Note: There may be more than one sso_<n>.sp.idMap property (for example, sso_1.sp.idMap, sso_2.sp.idMap, etc). 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

Option #1: 

The idAssertion value means that no entry is necessary for the user in the user registry, which is not supported in WebSphere Portal by default. Update the sso_<n>.sp.idMap property via the Integrated Solutions Console to use the value "localRealm" instead of "idAssertion." 

The localRealm value ensures that WebSphere Application Server will complete the JAAS Subject with the full distinguished name for the user by querying the user registry and thus Portal will pass the correct format to VMM.

 IBM ADMIN_CMD('load from ...') using JDBC in XA transaction gets SQL30090N - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why does ADMIN_CMD('load from ...') using JDBC in XA transaction get SQL30090N? 

CAUSE
It is an known current limitation of DB2.

ANSWER
Here is an example message from a jdbctrace.log

SQLERRMC=SYSPROC.ADMIN_CMD;SQL30090;^@, DRIVER=4.19.49
-------------------

Symptoms:
- It does not throw any exception and the application finished without any problem but 
the data is not actually loaded into the table.
- If the same operation without XA transaction, it is succeeded and loaded data.
- From jdbctrace, SQL20397W and SQL30090N are logged.

The reason why:
The cause of the problem is LOAD does internal commit near the beginning of 
operation. The load internal commit got back SQL30090 error is standard 
behavior in XA environment. So ADMIN_CMD + LOAD does not work on XA.

Workaround:
Unfortunately, there is no way to do ADMIN_CMD + LOAD on XA.

RELATED INFORMATION

 IBM Is using a monitored JBoss Application Server with ITCAM for J2EE supported in a Windows service? - United States J2EE JBoss server Windows service LA2 fix TECHNOTE (FAQ)

THIS DOCUMENT APPLIES ONLY TO THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGE VERSION(S):
 US English 

QUESTION
 Is using a monitored JBoss Application Server with ITCAM for J2EE supported in a Windows service? 

ANSWER
When you configure the JBoss Application Service to run as a Windows service, you will download the JBoss native connectors [http://jbossweb.jboss.org/downloads/jboss-native-2-0-10] and modify the service.bat file. 

The JBoss service is not available to run as a Windows service when configured with the ITCAM for J2EE agent/DC because this involves changes to the JBoss native connector files and this is currently not supported. Additionally, there's no option to specify the Service name when configuring the JBoss server during the configuration steps. 

If you are using JBoss AS 7.1 or JBoss EAP 6.1.0 or 6.2.0 or 6.3.0, then you will need the to use the latest patch first, [https://developer.ibm.com/answers/questions/208313/how-do-i-download-the-new-itcam-for-j2ee-711-la-if.html]then run the standalone.bat (or domain.bat) program from the command-line after successful configuration. 

Note: If you have a Tomcat server, then you will be able to use that server in a Service, the technote is here. [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21961542]

 IBM FileNet Content Manager object store addon creation fails on IBM DB2 pureScale - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Excessive lock duration during FileNet CM object store addon creation may result in SQL lock timeouts that will cause addon installation to fail. 

SYMPTOM
DB transactions are rolled back due to SQL timeout.


CAUSE
When multiple DB2 pureScale members are active during FileNet CM addon creation, excessive SQL locking may occur, resulting in a potential lock timeout. This can result in transactions being rolled back, thereby resulting in the addon installation failing.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Examine both the P8 error log and the DB2 diagnostic logs for each active member for lock timeout error messages similar to the following:


DB2 (db2diag.log):
FUNCTION: DB2 UDB, lock manager, sqlplWaitOnWP, probe:999 

 MESSAGE : ZRC=0x80100044=-2146435004=SQLP_LTIMEOUT
"LockTimeOut - tran rollback Reason code 68 

P8 (p8_server_error.log): 
com.filenet.api.exception.EngineRuntimeException: FNRCE0019E: E_DEADLOCK_ERROR: The operation could not be completed due to a deadlock error. A retry might be appropriate.
Caused by: com.ibm.db2.jcc.am.SqlTransactionRollbackException: DB2 SQL Error: SQLCODE=-911, SQLSTATE=40001, SQLERRMC=68, DRIVER=4.15.82

Note: The SQLERRMC=68 suggests that the root cause is a SQL lock timeout even though the P8 error message and SQLCODE suggest a deadlock occurred.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The lock timeouts can be avoided by only having a single DB2 pureScale member active during FileNet CM addon installation. Once addon installation has completed successfully, the other members can be brought back online.

Important: OCR-A support for Hebrew and Japanese requires the IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture interim fix, 8.1.0.2-Datacap-Taskmaster-WIN-IF-OCRA:0609577 [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?product=ibm/Information+Management/Datacap+Taskmaster+Capture&release=All&platform=All&function=fixId&fixids=8.1.0.2-Datacap-Taskmaster-WIN-IF-OCRA%3A0609577&includeSupersedes=0], which is available at IBM Support Fix Central [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral].

For Japanese, OCR-A is recommended instead of OCR-S/OCR-SR, because OCR-S confidence calculation might return high confidence for replaced characters.

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 A variable provided in a User Defined Function call is not received within the function action. 

SYMPTOM
The User Defined Function call is of the style: 

 * 
 * 


and MyResultSet was acquired in a previous GetBy - for example: 

 * 


and this was proven to have received a result: 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


Any attempt to use that value in the User Defined Function will report a NULL style error if it is not able to handle a null value or just simply fail to produce the expected results. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Assigning the variable prior to the function call will ensure that the value is passed to the User Defined Function. Using the above example we can rewrite this as: 




 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *

 IBM SQL1763N error with Reason Code 11 while running "Alter Tablespace" command to reclaim unused storage space against DMS or automatic storage tablespaces. - United States SQL1763N; Alter Tablespace; reclaimable storage; DMS; Automatic storage table spaces; MON_GET_TABLESPACE; RECLAIMABLE_SPACE_ENABLED; SMS; DB2 Version 9.7; lower high water mark TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Receiving SQL1763N error with Reason Code 11 while running "Alter Tablespace" command to reclaim unused storage space against DMS or automatic storage tablespaces. 

SYMPTOM
Following reasons apply: 

 * If the DMS or automatic storage tablespaces are not created in DB2 Version 9.7 or later, as the "Reclaimable Storage" is not available in tablespaces created in earlier versions(V9.1/V9.5) of the DB2 product. 
 * Trying to alter a SMS tablespace as this feature is not supported on SMS tablespaces. 


Example testcase on a TEMPSPACE1 SMS tablespace. 

 * 
 * 
 * DB21034E The command was processed as an SQL statement because it was not a valid Command Line Processor command. During SQL processing it returned: SQL1763N Invalid ALTER TABLESPACE statement for table space "TEMPSPACE1" due to reason "11" SQLSTATE=429BC 
 * 
   


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
MON_GET_TABLESPACE table function and RECLAIMABLE_SPACE_ENABLED monitor element can be used to identify whether the tablespace is enabled for reclaimable storage or not. Example: 
db2 "SELECT varchar(tbsp_name, 30) as tbsp_name, tbsp_type, RECLAIMABLE_SPACE_ENABLED FROM TABLE(MON_GET_TABLESPACE('',-2))" 

 

Snippet of the output: 

 

TBSP_NAME TBSP_TYPE RECLAIMABLE_SPACE_ENABLED
----------------- ----------- -------------------------
SYSCATSPACE DMS 1
TEMPSPACE1 SMS 0
USERSPACE1 DMS 1 

If the RECLAIMABLE_SPACE_ENABLED monitor element returns a value of 1, then the tablespace is enabled for reclaimable storage. Otherwise, it returns a value of 0.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To use the reclaimable storage feature, make sure to create the DMS or automatic storage tablespaces in DB2 Version 9.7 or later. Example testcase on SYSCATSPACE DMS tablespace which has reclaimable storage enabled. 

 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


Note: 
Tablespaces migrated from DB2 V9.1/V9.5 to V9.7 won't get upgraded directly to use the reclaimable storage feature. RELATED INFORMATION

 IBM How to export and import keys from an HSM-enabled IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I export and import private keys between the same or different Hardware Security Module (HSM) enabled IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance? 

ANSWER
HSM-enabled DataPower appliances support the export of private keys using the crypto-export command. For key export to work, various conditions must be met: 

 * HSMs must be initialized and in the same key sharing domain on exporting and importing machines 
 * The private key in question must be marked exportable at keygen time (see keygen's exportable option) 
 * HSMs on exporting and importing machines must share internal key-wrapping keys (see hsm-clone-kwk command). A key-wrapping key is a key that encrypts another key.


Each HSM has a special key inside of it, the key-wrapping key, that is used to encrypt exported private keys (and to decrypt imported private keys). If the goal is to restore exported keys to the same appliance, then you don't need to worry about hsm-clone-kwk, red keys, or the hsm-domain parameter. That is because the key-wrapping key at import time will already match the key-wrapping key at export time (since the HSM device is the same). If the goal is to move exported keys from one appliance to another one, then all of the steps in this section must be followed :- 

First, the two HSMs in question must be both be initialized and in the same key sharing domain. This means that they must both be initialized in the same mode (both in Security Level 2 or both in Security Level 3). In Security Level 2 mode, they must have used the same hsm-domain parameter during hsm-reinit (this parameter has a default value that is the same on all appliances). In Security Level 3 mode, they must have used the same red PED key during hsm-reinit (and the second initialization must not have overwritten the key value from the first initialization). 

Second, the key to be exported must be exportable. The exportability of keys is immutable. It is determined at keygen time, and it is controlled by that command's exportable parameter. If a key was created outside of the appliance (not using keygen), then it is always considered exportable. 

Finally, before the crypto-export crypto-import sequence, the key-wrapping keys must be synchronized using the hsm-clone-kwk command. This command must be run four times: once on the source HSM appliance (with the key-wrapping key you are copying), once on the destination HSM appliance, once again on the source HSM appliance, and once again on the destination HSM appliance. Each time the command is run, it will need the output file from the previous step (as the input to the current step) which must be moved manually (usually with the copy command). 

Once all of this has been done, then private keys may move from system to system with crypto-export and crypto-import. 

Note that the non-HSM appliance can export keys immediately at keygen time, but never at a later time. 

For additional information refer to the online Info Center [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wsdatap/v3r8m2/index.jsp?topic=%2Fxi50%2Fwelcome.htm] and search for "PIN entry device".

 IBM Setting a big session time-out value in DASH causes session lock-out - United States DASHL2; session; time-out; timeout; cannot login; locked out ; 2147483647; security.xml TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Using a big value (2147483647) for the session timeout setting in DASH, to achieve the maximum time between timeouts, is causing users to be locked out completely. 

SYMPTOM
After entering the user ID and password in the login page, and then pressing the "continue" button,
the login page does not change, stuck at "processing" and then returns to the login page again." 

All users get essentially locked out completely from DASH sessions.


CAUSE
In order to maximize the time between session timeouts, the customer is setting the timeout parameter in the security.xml file to 2147483647.

This timeout parameter used in the security.xml file is a WAS setting, but DASH is using a javascript call (settimeout), which causes a condition that prevents a login, if the timeout value is really big. 


Note: 2147483647 is the maximum positive value for a 32-bit signed binary integer in computing.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This condition that prevents logins can be averted by setting the custom property LTPAFIX in the consoleProperties.xml to "false". 


Please follow this steps: 

1. On DASH server, navigate to <JazzSM Home>/profile/config/cells/JazzSMNode01Cell/applications/isc.ear/deployments/isc/isclite.war/WEB-INF 

 
2. Take a backup of consoleProperties.xml 

 
3. Open consoleProperties.xml in edit-mode. 

 
4. Search for "LTPAFIX" and change the value from "true" to "false". 


Example: 

Before 
===== 
<consoleproperties:console-property id="LTPAFIX" value="true"/> 
</consoleproperties:ibm-portal-consoleproperties> 

After 
==== 
<consoleproperties:console-property id="LTPAFIX" value="false"/> 
</consoleproperties:ibm-portal-consoleproperties> 

5. Save the file. 

 
6. Restart DASH server. 

 IBM How to Proxy SSL request from DataPower to Remote Proxy Server? - United States Forward Proxy XMLFW MPGW CONNECT TUNNEL TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How to configure an IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance Service to proxy an SSL request to a remote proxy server using the CONNECT method for SSL tunneling? 

CAUSE
Many common forward proxy servers expect requests in different formats depending on if they are proxying non-SSL or SSL requests.

For example, a non-SSL request to be proxied may come in the form of GET hostname:port/URI.

For SSL requests to be proxied, remote proxy servers are commonly configured to tunnel the request from the client to the backend server.

In the SSL request scenario, remote proxy servers will typically expect a CONNECT request and then tunnel the SSL request from the client to the backend server.

Users configuring DataPower may need a way to implement this CONNECT method for SSL tunneling to a remote Proxy Server.




RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Non-SSL Proxy requests will work using either:

a) an XML Firewall when configuring in the HTTP Options tab, where the user can configure the Proxy Host and Port

b) a Multi-Protocol Gateway when configuring an HTTP Proxy Policy in the User Agent

SSL Proxy requests will work using the CONNECT method for SSL Tunneling when using a Multi-Protocol Gateway when configuring in a User Agent's HTTP Proxy Policy.

The XML Firewall service is not designed to use the CONNECT method for SSL Tunneling. 

 IBM How to troubleshoot images not appearing in PDF/Excel in Report Studio - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Unable to view images in reports in PDF/Excel output when using Report Studio/Workspace. 
However images are visible in HTML format when reports are run actively. 

SYMPTOM
Unable to view images in reports in PDF/Excel output when using Report Studio/Workspace. 
However images are visible in HTML format when reports are run actively.

The PDF/Excel outputs will have a placeholder image. This will be in the form of an empty black box (PDF) or will be a missing pictures icon (Excel).


CAUSE
There are a few common causes for this issue: 

 1. The permissions of the folder which contains the image, have not been configured correctly 
 2. The image is not within the directory which is specified 
 3. The directory where the image is meant to be stored, does not exist in the specified location

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
To find out the root cause of this problem, you will need to use tools that monitor and record all actions attempted against the Operating System Registry. 

In THIS scenario the tool used was Process Monitor and the Web Server was IIS 7.5. 

 

 1.  Download Process Monitor tool (Make sure you run it from the same machine Cognos is installed on) 
 2.  Open up the report in Cognos Workspace 
 3.  Load up Process Monitor 
 4.  You will notice the current processes immediately being captured and displaying in the window. Press the Capture / Ctrl+E Icon (Magnifying Glass) to stop the capture of events. 
 5.  Press the Clear / Ctrl+X icon (Eraser) to remove all the recorded entries. 
 6.  Press the capture icon in process monitor 
 7.  Export the report to Excel 2007/PDF 
 8.  Save the file anywhere 
 9.  Press the Capture icon again in process monitor to stop the capturing of events. 
 10. Press the Find Icon / Ctrl+F and type "[Image Name]" to make sure the filter image event was captured. 
 11. You should be able to see the reason why the image could not be saved under the 'Result' column.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If the image is found but cannot be accessed due to permission configuration issue: 

 

 1. Open up IIS 7.5 
 2. Click on the root folder of your Cognos installation (E.g. C1021GA) in the navigation pane on the left side 
 3. When the root folder is selected, double-click 'Authentication' 
 4. Ensure that anonymous access is enabled 
 5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for the image folder and it's parent folder. 
 6. If the user is concerned about security, they may want to restrict the child-folders (E.g. cgi-bin) and change the authentication settings accordingly 
 7. Run the report in export as Excel 2007 and PDF


If the image/ directory is not located: 

Place the image/directory in the specified location

 IBM How do I adjust the number of batches that DotEdit displays in IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture? - United States batch; list TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I want to increase the number of batches that IBM Datacap DotEdit displays. It only displays 100 and there are more than 100 batches available. What needs to be done to increase the list? 

CAUSE
The default limit is 100 rows, but this number can be modified by editing the file \Datacap\DotEdit\apps.ini file.

ANSWER
Please do the following: 

 1. Backup the \Datacap\DotEdit\apps.ini file. If the file does not exist, create a new one or copy it from \Datacap\tmweb.net. 
 2. Open it in notepad.exe or other editor. 
 3. Find the app to be modified (for example [APT]). If it does not exist, create a new section with the application name listed between square brackets. 
 4. Add a new line containing BatchLimit=xxx, where xxx is the number of batches to be displayed. 
 5. Save the file.


Additional information: 
 * For version 8.1, Fix Pack 1 or newer must be installed. 
 * Increasing the number of batches displayed is known to cause a slowdown in perceived response time due to gathering and formatting of the batch list. 
 * The optimum number will vary due to system conditions, infrastructure and user expectation. 
 * The DotEdit batch list will be slower to display than the batch list in Taskmaster Web, due to architectural differences between the applications.

 IBM How to export and import keys from an HSM-enabled IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I export and import private keys between the same or different Hardware Security Module (HSM) enabled IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance? 

ANSWER
HSM-enabled DataPower appliances support the export of private keys using the crypto-export command. For key export to work, various conditions must be met: 

 * HSMs must be initialized and in the same key sharing domain on exporting and importing machines 
 * The private key in question must be marked exportable at keygen time (see keygen's exportable option) 
 * HSMs on exporting and importing machines must share internal key-wrapping keys (see hsm-clone-kwk command). A key-wrapping key is a key that encrypts another key.


Each HSM has a special key inside of it, the key-wrapping key, that is used to encrypt exported private keys (and to decrypt imported private keys). If the goal is to restore exported keys to the same appliance, then you don't need to worry about hsm-clone-kwk, red keys, or the hsm-domain parameter. That is because the key-wrapping key at import time will already match the key-wrapping key at export time (since the HSM device is the same). If the goal is to move exported keys from one appliance to another one, then all of the steps in this section must be followed :- 

First, the two HSMs in question must be both be initialized and in the same key sharing domain. This means that they must both be initialized in the same mode (both in Security Level 2 or both in Security Level 3). In Security Level 2 mode, they must have used the same hsm-domain parameter during hsm-reinit (this parameter has a default value that is the same on all appliances). In Security Level 3 mode, they must have used the same red PED key during hsm-reinit (and the second initialization must not have overwritten the key value from the first initialization). 

Second, the key to be exported must be exportable. The exportability of keys is immutable. It is determined at keygen time, and it is controlled by that command's exportable parameter. If a key was created outside of the appliance (not using keygen), then it is always considered exportable. 

Finally, before the crypto-export crypto-import sequence, the key-wrapping keys must be synchronized using the hsm-clone-kwk command. This command must be run four times: once on the source HSM appliance (with the key-wrapping key you are copying), once on the destination HSM appliance, once again on the source HSM appliance, and once again on the destination HSM appliance. Each time the command is run, it will need the output file from the previous step (as the input to the current step) which must be moved manually (usually with the copy command). 

Once all of this has been done, then private keys may move from system to system with crypto-export and crypto-import. 

Note that the non-HSM appliance can export keys immediately at keygen time, but never at a later time. 

For additional information refer to the online Info Center [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wsdatap/v3r8m2/index.jsp?topic=%2Fxi50%2Fwelcome.htm] and search for "PIN entry device".

======================================================================================


CAUSE
The database was not created using UTF-8 character encoding. 


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
On an Oracle® environment you can run these SQL statements to determine the character sets: 



SELECT VALUE FROM NLS_DATABASE_PARAMETERS WHERE PARAMETER IN ('NLS_CHARACTERSET', 'NLS_NCHAR_CHARACTERSET'); 
SELECT PROPERTY_VALUE FROM DATABASE_PROPERTIES WHERE PROPERTY_NAME IN 
('NLS_CHARACTERSET', 'NLS_NCHAR_CHARACTERSET'); 

In this case the customer had these results for both SQL statements:

============================= 
PROPERTY_VALUE 
------------- 
WE8ISO8859P1 
AL16UTF16 
=============================

If the database character sets had been setup correctly then both lines would have read "AL16UTF16". In this case NLS_CHARACTERSET returns "WE8ISO8859P1" which is not a supported format. If the database had been setup correctly both lines would have produced "AL16UTF16". 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
At this point there is no way to salvage the database in its current state. The entire Portal database must be dropped and recreated using the specifications provided in the InfoCenter at this link: 


http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wpdoc/v6r1m0/topic/com.ibm.wp.e [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wpdoc/v6r1m0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.wp.ent.doc/config/aix_oracle_create_db.html]

This is the specific information in the Information Center pertaining to character encoding:

=============================

All databases must be created using UNICODE Database and National character sets such as UTF8, AL32UTF8, or AL16UTF16.

 IBM How to process an IBM SDK core dump with Jextract (AIX, Linux, Windows) - United States crash; coredump; dumps; dump; dmp; dmps; jextracted; jextract; userdump; dtfj TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How do you process a raw core dump using Jextract? 

Jextract is a tool provided with the IBM SDK to process and compress a core dump for later processing with tools such as DTFJ, which can be downloaded with IBM Support Assistant. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You can process a core dump with Jextract, as long as the dump itself was produced by the IBM WebSphere Application Server JVM and is processed on the same system as the dump. 

A processed dump can be used in both the Eclipse Memory Analyzer Tool [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/tools/mat.html] and the DTFJ Dump Analyzer [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/tools/dumpanalyzer/]. Both are included as downloadable tools from within IBM Support Assistant Workbench [http://www.ibm.com/software/support/isa/]. 




Locating the Core Dump 

For WebSphere Application Server installations, the default location for the core dumps is in the profile's root directory: <WAS_HOME>/profiles/<PROFILE_NAME>/ 

The file extension will usually be *.dmp, but on some versions of AIX and Linux, the file may simply be named core. The process id and the date stamp are normally appended to the name of the file. 




Processing the Dump 

Execute the jextract command on the same system and installation of WebSphere Application Server that the core dump was produced on. If you don't use the full path on AIX or Linux, make sure to use ./jextract (including the dot-slash) so the correct executable is picked up. 

Replace [COREDUMP_PATH] with the full path plus filename of the core dump produced. 

 

If you do not know if compressed references is enabled, scroll to the FAQ section for a brief explanation. 

 

Determining the Java Directory 

Because different profiles on WebSphere Application Server 8.5.5.X and later can use different SDKs, the java directory inside the installation folder can differ. To determine the path, check the process list for the application server process and see which folder the java executable is being launched from. 

 

NOTE: If you are on WebSphere Liberty and are using an IBM SDK, the entire path to that SDK will differ. 

 




32-bit JVM and
64-bit JVM with Compressed References disabled
AIX/Linux: 
<WAS_HOME>/<JAVA_DIR>/jre/bin/jextract [COREDUMP_PATH]

Windows: 
<WAS_HOME>\<JAVA_DIR>\jre\bin\jextract.exe [COREDUMP_PATH]




64-bit JVM with Compressed References enabled
Does not apply to WebSphere Application Server 6.1
AIX/Linux: 
<WAS_HOME>/<JAVA_DIR>/jre/bin/jextract -J-Xcompressedrefs [COREDUMP_PATH]

Windows: 
<WAS_HOME>\<JAVA_DIR>\jre\bin\jextract.exe -J-Xcompressedrefs [COREDUMP_PATH] 

 




Max Heap Size 

To adjust the max heap size, you can add -J-Xmx to adjust the size. For example, -J-Xmx1024m allows for a max heap size of 1024 MB when jextract is run. 

 

 




Files Generated 

The output will determine where the compressed data is stored (usually a .zip extension, .sdff is seen on older environments). Check the location of the core dump as that will be the most common location. 

Core files are usually compressible since a lot of data is zero; 10x compression can be expected in the resulting zip file 

 

If you find XML files in the output directory, this may mean jextract failed, as these files are supposed to be placed automatically within the SDFF or ZIP file. 

 




Error Messages 

EyeCatcher Error
Unable to find J9VMRAS eyecatcher
Error. Internal failure detected during jextract 

This error message indicates that jextract failed to identify the dump. This could be due to a number of things, including 

* The dump was not produced by WebSphere Application Server
* The dump was produced from a native library or component such as a JNI component or database driver.
* (AIX only) The dump generated is in an incompatible dump format due to an AIX OS issue (see APAR IZ88097 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IZ88097] for more details). 

 

Out of Memory Error 

Sometimes the core dump is much larger than the default heap size can manage, and the recommendation is to increase the heap size using the -J-Xmx option. 

 




FAQ 

How do I determine if compressed references is enabled? 

Compressed references were first introduced in 64-bit builds of IBM SDK 6.0. If WebSphere Application Server is at version 7.0.0.3 or higher, it will be enabled by default; see APAR PK75174 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK75174]. 

Checking the JVM arguments in the admin console can verify if compressed references was enabled manually. However, it's best to check the ps output or the javacore for the argument -Xcompressedrefs 

If you find the argument -Xnocompressedrefs has been added, this means it's disabled (see page 7 of this document [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/webserver/appserv/was/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf] for more info)) 

 

What happens to jextract if I cannot determine if compressed references was enabled? 

If you run jextract and did not realize compressed references was enabled, the output will ask you to rerun jextract and add the following argument: -J-Xcompressedrefs

 IBM UDX compilation error - United States  TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

THIS DOCUMENT APPLIES ONLY TO THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGE VERSION(S):
 English 

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Following error can be met during UDX compilation.
Can't exec "/nz/kit/bin/adm/nzudxcompile": Argument list too long 

SYMPTOM
nzudxcompile command returns an "Argument list too long" error and aborts.


CAUSE
ARG_MAX configuration parameter limits the number of argument list in command line. In this case the client used more than 131072 argument with many program *.c files.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check ARG_MAX value in the command line: 

$ getconf ARG_MAX
131072


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This ARG_MAX kernel parameter adjusted to much larger from kernel release version 2.6.23, that is 2621440 (http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/argmax [http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/argmax]). 

But we support upto Redhat 5.11 in Twinfin which is less than kernel release 2.6.23. So we have no way to allow ARG_MAX larger than 131072 at this time. 

 IBM When and how to apply a modification or fix pack - United States fix pack update bug correction APAR TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 When and how should I apply a modification or fix pack to my JRules or Operational Decision Management (WODM/ODM) installation?


CAUSE
The Operational Decision Manager version numbers use the standard IBM formatV.R.M.Fwhich stands for Version.Release.Modification.Fixpack. See the V.R.M.F Maintenance Stream Delivery Vehicle terminology explanation [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27008656] for more details. 


Modification and fix pack numbers are the third and fourth digits in the IBM product version number, for example: 8.5.M.F. 


Modification and fix packs include only bug fixes, so they do not affect the product functionality or your data.


See the following technotes to find out which update your installation need:


 * Finding the version of ODM product and fixes [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21627850] to determine the exact product versions that are installed on your machine.
   
 * Find the version of ODM components [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21400738] to determine the exact module or library versions that are deployed on your servers.
   
 * Operational Decision Manager Download document [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24031636] to learn about the latest modification or fix pack that is available for your product version. 
   
 * IBM Operational Decision Manager detailed system requirements [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27023067] to verify that your configuration is supported with your current product version.
   
 * IBM Support Lifecycle [http://www.ibm.com/software/websphere/support/lifecycle/] to verify that your current version does not reach end of support in the near future.



Referring to the last two documents above, you may find out that you need to migrate to the latest product version to ensure continued support of your applications. In that case, refer to technote Migrating to the latest version of Operational Decision Management [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21589725]. 

That being said, make sure to consider migrating to the latest version or release ( V.R.M.F) of the product as soon as possible to benefit from the latest added features and improvements. 
ANSWER
As with any software product, even if you do not have any issues with running your current configuration, you should apply the latest modification or fix pack to take advantage of these benefits: 

 * Anticipate and avoid the risk of encountering defects already fixed. 
 * Apply the latest product improvements that are available (performance, for example). 
 * Maintain a serviceable system and be able to install an interim fix when required.



WHEN TO UPDATE
The latest modification or fix pack should be installed as soon as it is available. 

You can subscribe to the IBM Support My Notifications [https://www.ibm.com/support/mynotifications] to be notified of any fix pack releases, and you can also bookmark the Operational Decision Manager Download document [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24031636] page, which lists the latest modifications or fix packs. 

See the technote Fix pack release notification for Operational Decision Manager [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21665593] to find out when a modification or fix pack will be available.






BEFORE UPDATING


The databases used in the sample server are deleted and recreated during the update. If you are using those databases and want to save the existing content, perform the following steps before updating: 
 *  Stop the sample server. In the folder <ODM_HOME>/shared/data/derby, create an archive file containing the resdb and rtsdb folders. Save the archive file, such as zip file, in the data folder. After installation, unzip the archive file in the folder <ODM_HOME>/shared/data/derby to restore your databases before restarting the sample server. 



A new profile is also created for the sample server, at the first server start following the installation of a modification or fix pack. 

If you want to continue using the same ports, you must delete the existing profile prior. In the <ODM_HOME>/shared/bin folder, from the command line, run the command ../tools/ant/bin/ant forcedestroyprofile. 


Note: The sample server is not designed to be used in a production system. For a production system, you must create a dedicated profile and database that you update using the following steps. 




UPDATING


Each modification or fix pack page provides instructions on how to download and run the installer, in addition to providing a list of corrections that are included in the update. 

The fix pack installation updates the following files and folders:  * JAR libraries in the installation directories, including <ODMInstallDir>\<Module>\lib. 
 * EAR and WAR applications in the <ODMInstallDir>\<Module>\applicationservers\<App Server> folders.


Once this is done, you perform these tasks:  * Repackage your client applications with the up-to-date libraries. 
 * Reapply product customizations to the up-to-date Java EE modules (EARs and WARs).



Note that all customizations you developed before the update, for example modifications of the descriptors, must be reapplied to the new, up-to-date EARs and WARs. It is a good idea to document and automate those customizations using scripts to make the process easier and error-proof. 

Finally, you must update the client applications and ODM modules on your server or servers with the same settings as you deployed previously. If you redeploy the application, follow again the documentation instructions to deploy all ODM modules to your servers [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r5m1/topic/com.ibm.odm.distrib.config/topics/odm_distrib_config.html]. 

Keep in mind that applying a modification or a fix pack does not require any data migration, so your projects and database remain the same. 

UPDATING RULE EXECUTION SERVER


Update the following applications in the application server:  *  jrules-res-xu-<server>.rar jrules-res-management-<server>.ear jrules-ssp-<server>.ear jrules-res-htds-<server>ear 


Make sure you do not change the class loading policies for applications and modules ( parent last for all ODM modules). 

Note: Updating the eXecution Unit RAR file requires a restart of the server. 


UPDATE DECISION CENTER


Update the following application in your application server: 
 * jrules-teamserver-<server>.ear


Make sure you do not change the class loading policies for applications and modules ( parent last for all ODM modules). 

UPDATE THE EVENTS RUNTIME

 1. Stop the event runtime application, wberuntimeear. 
 2. Uninstall the following applications, if they exist:  * wbefileconnector 
     * wbehttpconnector 
     * wbejdbcconnector 
     * wbejmsconnector 
     * wbesoapconnector
    
    
 3. Update the application wberuntimeear. 
 4. Start the application wberuntimeear.


Make sure you do not change the class loading policies for applications and modules ( parent last for all ODM modules). 




ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
 * Again, in addition to applying the latest modification or fix pack, consider migrating to the latest version or release (V.R.M.F) of the product as soon as possible to benefit from recently added features and improvements. See our technote Migrating to the latest version of Operational Decision Management [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21589725] for more information. 
 * For JRules 7.1, you can refer to the JRules 7.1 list of fix packs [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27019787] and also Upgrading JRules to the latest V7.1 fix pack [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21474292] to learn how to apply the fix packs. But note that JRules 7.1 reaches end of support in September 2015 (see the IBM Support Lifecycle [http://www.ibm.com/software/websphere/support/lifecycle/] page). To ensure continued product support, plan an upgrade to the latest product version before that date.

 IBM Java SDK Upgrade Policy for the IBM WebSphere Application Server - United States upgrade policy TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What is the Java™ SDK upgrade policy for the IBM® WebSphere® Application Server? 

CAUSE
Updating to the latest compatible Java SDK could help you resolve problems more quickly.

ANSWER
The IBM WebSphere Application Server Java SDK can be upgraded to the latest service release for the same Java SDK version. 

List of WebSphere Application Server fix packs and the corresponding Java SDK versions [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg27005002]

Policy Summary by WebSphere Application Server release:

WebSphere Application Server V8.0, V8.5, V8.5.5
Starting with V8.0 and applicable to all subsequent releases and fixpacks, there is one install package that contains updates for both WebSphere Application Server and Java SDK. Applying fixpacks of WebSphere Application Server also upgrades the SDK that is packaged and bundled within the fixpack. Additionally, separate Java SDK fixpacks are also available that contain just the SDK updates which can be applied to upgrade the SDK.

WebSphere Application Server V7.0
Any V7.0 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.6.0 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.

WebSphere Application Server V6.1
Any V6.1 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.5.0 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.

WebSphere Application Server V6.0
Any V6.0 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.4.2 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.

WebSphere Application Server V5.1
Any V5.1 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.4.1 and any V5.1.1 can be upgraded to the latest Java SDK 1.4.2 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.

WebSphere Application Server V5.0
Any V5.0 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.3.1 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.



Details of Java SDK Upgrade Policy

WebSphere Application Server leverages the Java SDK as a base component. This results in unique support issues, including:


 * Matching Java SDK service releases to Application Server releases and fix packs
   
   
 * Delivering updates and fixes associated with the Java SDK on any given Application Server release.


In an effort to resolve customer Java SDK situations as quickly as possible, WebSphere Application Server Support has done a quickest-path-to-resolution analysis, determining the most direct way to collect problem information. 

In some cases, problem resolution might include finding shortcuts to resolve symptoms. One shortcut is an immediate upgrade to a newer compatible Java SDK service release, before gathering detailed problem determination data. 

There are multiple advantages to performing an immediate Java SDK upgrade as a quicker path to resolution over a full Problem Determination (PD) process: 
 1. There is a continuous stream of fixes going into the Java SDK. Many problems encountered by customers are resolved by these fixes.
    
    
 2. When a new problem is encountered, applying the latest Java SDK is a quick way to determine if related fixes change the symptoms or correct the problem.
    
    
 3. Many documented Java SDK fixes have common symptoms. Frequently, limited PD data does not isolate the problem to a single root cause.
    


These factors highlight the advantage of applying a newer Java SDK before working through a full PD cycle. 

Java SDK and WebSphere Application Server software are updated frequently. To avoid compatibility issues for customers, WebSphere Application Server Support maintains this Java SDK Upgrade Policy. 

WebSphere Application Server Support details: 
http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/support.html [http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/support.html] 

Identifying compatibility limitations between WebSphere Application Server releases and Java SDK service releases that have not been tested together reduces risk. 

Important: Using a Java SDK not specifically packaged with WebSphere Application Server and supplied by IBM, or in violation of the Java SDK Upgrade Policy, is not supported by IBM WebSphere Application Server Support for Java SDK problems. RELATED INFORMATION

 IBM Distribute Decision Validation Service tests on different Rule Execution Server instances - United States SSPResolver; SSP TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Can I configure Rules Team Server to distribute the Decision Validation Service tests to multiple application servers? 

CAUSE
With a Rule Execution Server environment defined on a domain with multiple servers it is possible to define which Rule Execution Server instances will be used to execute the Rule Team Server Decision Services

ANSWER
First remember to pack all your XOMs (eXecutable Object Model) into the ssp.war following the documentation [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc/Content/Business_Rules/Documentation/_pubskel/JRules/ps_JRules_Global720.html]. 

Then make sure the SSP (ssp.war) is deployed on each server along with a XU connection factory and the appropriate datasource definition. 

 

Then create your own SSP resolver, add it to the teamserver.war and set the teamserver.defaultSSPResolver.class property to this class following this specification [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc/html/api/html/ilog/rules/teamserver/model/testing/IlrSSPResolver.html]. 

 

By implementing your own method IlrSSPResolver.getSSPURL(String serverName,URL url), you will be able to point to something else than the default provider. 

The default provider uses the url of the Rule Execution Server passed in parameter and replaces the application name with testing. 

A simple implementation can use the server name to return a specific server URL. 

for example you can have 2 servers defined in RTS: 

 * testingServer1 http://host1:9080/res 
 * testingServer2 http://host1:9080/res


And your SSP provider can evaluate the SSP URL as follow : 
if ( serverName.equals("testingServer1") )
{
return ( new URL( "http://server1:9080/testing" ) );
}
else if ( serverName.equals("testingServer2") )
{
return ( new URL( "http://server2:9080/testing" );
}
else 
return( new URL( "http://host1:9080/testing" )); 

 

Then when running a DVS test the execution will be dispatched according to the server you choose. 

 

For a more elaborate implementation you can have a dependency with the project being tested so that you can distribute the DVS execution based on a project: 


ManagerBean bean = ManagerBean.getInstance() ; 
IlrSession session = bean.getSession(); 
IlrRuleProject project = session.getWorkingBaseline().getProject();
String pname = project.getName(); 

.
